Just as background, Gataga was a wonderful tool for searching multiple tagging services in one go. enter a tag on the command line, and see results from delicious, furl, flickr, etc… See our profiles above more more information. We just received an email from Vic at Gataga: Hi Mike… Just to let you know that we’ve had to take Gataga down for various reasons which I can’t get into now. Thanks for all the help, comments and write ups. We really appreciate it. Vic There’s no additional explanation on their blog. They went right from “We’ve improved the accuracy for bookmark searches” to “We’ve been summoned back to our home planet” Since sites are generally not taken down unless there is legal pressure to do so, our assumption is that Gataga got into some sort of trouble for its service. We do note, however, that Technorati and others have very similar tag searches that show results from other sites. What happened to Gataga?

,Profile – Browster,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/13/profile-browster/,"Company:  Browster Launch Date: Beta in February 2005, Version 1.0 launched today, July 13, 2005 What is it? Browster is a tool, available only for IE (damn, I just lost half of my readers right there) that pre-fetches content from links on a web page, and makes that content available by mousing-over the link. Too see it visually click here . So we dusted off IE (used only for FTP these days), downloaded 334k of stuff and had at it. Browster allows you to browse search results more quickly and with fewer clicks. Browster will also pre-fetch content from non-search sites if you tell it to (there are a couple of easy ways to do this). There is a nice feature to basically scroll through search results quickly by clicking on an arrow. It’s hard to explain but works very well. Browster has CPC advertisements on the top of its window. I don’t mind the ads, but the copyright holders of the content they are showing may. I also wish they would have focused on Firefox before IE…Even though IE still has a very large market share, it seems like most of the cutting edge users are on firefox, or macs. Not having support for those browsers is a serious mistake because your most important customers (bloggers, for instance) won’t use it. Tom Foremski wrote about Browster a few hours ago and pointed out a number of very serious flaws (we agree with some, disagree with others). At the end of the day, our only real concerns are those mentioned above (browser support and copyright infringement issues). From a business model perspective, there’s very little that’s viral or sticky about the product. That means ultimately their liquidity event valuation may be based on their technology rather than their network. It’s a great tool and as soon as they support firefox I’ll use it regularly.

,Profile – Wikipedia,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/12/profile-wikipedia/,"Service:  Wikipedia Created: January 15, 2001 Summary: Wikipedia has been around for over 5 years, is the largest wiki (by far) and serves over 400 million page views per month (to compare, USA Today has about 300 million). Wikipedia is a free, online, user-written encyclopedia in wiki format that was created in 2001 by Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales . It has grown at an astonishing rate and now includes 1.6 million articles. More than 600,000 of these are in English, more than 250,000 in German, and more than 100,000 each in Japanese and French (wikipedia has editions in 205 languages, 92 of which are active). Many people don’t realize how easy it is for anyone to add content to wikipedia (I’ve done it several times). Each month, thousands of individuals add content to the project. We are writing about it today because it became the most comprehensive and most reliable center of knowledge as information became available about the London bombings on July 7. We posted about the attacks here , and noted in last weeks Web 2.0 wrapup that while the BBC and other news sites couldn’t keep up, wikipedia marched along without a hiccup and kept the world informed. Clay Shirky spoke about it, and Jim Phelps picked it up here : “Whenever there is a really major disaster but no immediate news, the people on cable are often vamping because they have to keep repeating the basic story on the chance that someone has just tuned in even in the absence of any new information. Wikipedia solves that problem while, at the same time, having a symbiotic relationship with those news outlets because it points people to the written form of stories” See also David Weinberger’s post on this here . For many of us, we started to fully understand the tremendous power of wikipedia as a cultural/knowledge aggregator on July 7, 2005. What are Wikis? A Wiki is a web application that allows users to add content, as on an Internet forum, but also allows anyone to edit the content. The first wiki was the Portland Pattern Repository , created  on March 25, 1995 by Ward Cunningham. A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review before modifications are accepted. Wikis generally practice the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes, rather than making it difficult to make them. The name is based on the Hawaiian term wiki wiki, meaning “quick” or “informal”. It is used commonly in Hawaii as part of the Hawaiian Pidgin language. Link History of Encyclopedias: Link An encyclopedia is a written compendium of knowledge. An excellent summary can be found here , at wikipedia: “The idea of collecting all of the world’s knowledge within arm’s reach under a single roof goes back to the ancient Library of Alexandria and Pergamon. Many writers of antiquity (such as Aristotle) attempted to write comprehensively about all human knowledge.” “Traditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text writers, usually people with an academic degree.” Today, most encyclopedias offer content online and charge a subscription fee for content ranging up to about $100 per year. How is Wikipedia different (and better)? Wikipedia combines wikis, which are aggregations of content created by users, and the idea of an encyclopedia. To summarize it further would be foolish – we cannot compete with tens of thousands of editors at wikipedia. See their entry for wikipedia here . At its core, wikipedia offers conent on a vast array of subjects (like web 2.0 ), and offers additional features such as a discussion forum for each item, editing tools to add content, and a page showing historical revisions to the text. Samuel Klein writes a beautiful post summarizing our thoughts exactly on what Wikipedia is, was and will become here . There are certainly problems with wikipedia, but these problems are inherent in the structure of wikis (when everyone can write, some people write crap). But it is tremendously resilient and self-healing, and an extremely important asset to the Internet culture.

,Profile – Planet Web 2.0,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/11/profile-planet-web-20/,"Service:  Planet Web 2.0 Launched: about two weeks ago What is it? Planet Web 2.0 is a website (and more importantly an RSS feed) that aggregates content from web 2.0 publishers around the web. It’s a must add feed for anyone tracking web 2.0. The sources of the content are linked on the sidebar, and include TechCrunch. :-) We first discovered the site while reading Richard MacManus’ excellent and much discussed post “ On Bots and Content Creation / Aggregation ” last week. We have lots of thoughts on Richard’s post (and generally, entirely agree with him). Our feeling is Planet Web 2.0, which goes out of its way to attribute content, is going about this inevitable evolution in the right way, and we support them. The debate on the issue of re-publishing content goes back as far as the web itself. RSS makes it even easier, of course. In fact, the entire purpose of RSS is the republishing of content. The debate centers on whether it should be republished only in RSS readers, or if it can be republished anywhere. In reality, though, what is the difference between an online RSS reader and a website? Not much, particuarly when you think about how bloglines and other readers allow sharing of feeds… Editor’s Note: To track the “old” debate on RSS and copyright, see Jason Calcanis , Robert Scoble ,  and Makeyougohmm to start. So here’s TechCrunch’s position: We like Planet Web 2.0 and think what is doing is a responsible way to promote content, while giving proper attribution to those who wrote it. In forming our position, we noted Ian Davis’s (the creator of Planet Web 2.0) comments on Richard’s post: “I think you’re uncovering some essential quality of content remixing that perhaps hasn’t been appreciated before. Aggregating and remixing content needs to be done with respect. We should respect the original author’s intent and also the time and effort they put into creating the content. Repurposing, passing off, non-attribution – these are all disrespectful ways to treat content and people. Hopefully I’m treating the writers with respect on Planet Web 2.0 (and other similar sites I host). Perhaps a little bit more traffic will flow to them or perhaps it’ll help people discover related writers to those they already know. Either way I appreciate the work that goes into the writing and only wish I could write half as well as those I read.” Link As long as this his position, and his actions reflect his position, we’re behind him all the way. On a related note, Nivi (another must read blog) created two aggregate feeds recently – the Venture Capital Channel and the Entrepreneur Channel . He does less attribution than Planet Web 2.0, but it’s clear that his motives are pure. We recommend both. Planet Web 2.0 Creator: Ian Davis Update: I spoke with Ian Davis by email and he provided the following insights on his site: “My motivation for setting up PW was to collect together the writings of people I respect in this space. I wanted to understand the Web 2.0 landscape and keep abreast of new developments and applications. I already had a small private subscription list but rather than keep keep it to myself I decided to publish and aggregate from it. I reasoned that if I was interested in this then there were bound to be others equally interested. Hopefully people will come across it via people they already read and discover other great writers. The site has only been active for a couple of weeks – I think I registered it on the 1st July. I’ve had a long-standing interest in open access to data, collaboration and the semantic web. I was involved in authoring the RSS 1.0 specification back in 2000 and at the time I saw this as the first step to an open network of data with RSS giving implied permission for reuse. Now, with Web 2.0, I think I have an exciting opportunity to apply the same principles to a much wider range of content and services. In fact, I’ve just started a new role at a British company called Talis leading development of the Silkworm project, a platform for enabling Web 2.0 applications. I’m having a lot of fun. It feels like I’ve just discovered Mosaic for the first time :)” Update: There have been a couple of posts that are related to the subject of content stealing/aggregation. This first is by Fred Wilson and he calls it the “internet Access of Evil” and he quotes a Jason Calcanis email. The second is by Michael Parekh , who noticed the same site stole his content. There is a line here, and some people choose to cross it. Really bad form. Tags: rss , copyright , planetweb2.0 , techcrunch , web2.0 , content",Web_2.0,2005-07-11 00:00:00
,Profile – Del.Icio.Us (New Feature),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/10/profile-delicious-new-feature/,"Company:  Deli.cio.us (new feature) Previous Profile:  June 16, 2005 What’s new? Josh Schachter (the creator of del.icio.us) announced new “tags for two” functionality yesterday. It allows direct bookmarket notification to a person, to suggest they see specific content. We first noticed a trend towards people using del.icio.us as a recommendation engine about a month ago. Fred Wilson, in addition to being THE web2.0 venture capitalist, loves music and posts regularly on music he is listening to. On June 4, 2005 he posted a request to his readers to recommend new music to him via del.icio.us: “If you find an mp3 file with its own URL, like my MP3 of the Week, simply tag it in delicious with a tag that is clearly your own.  For example, I use “fred’spodcast” as my tag.  Feel free to tag mp3s with that tag if you want me to listen to them. Then you take the RSS feed for that delicious tag, in my case http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/fred’spodcast , and burn that as a Feedburner feed.” We noticed it, and sort of put it in the back of our mind filed under “another cool del.icio.us tool”. Fred also set up a del.icio.us tag for his wife, Joanne. Whenever he wants her to see something on the web, he tags it “for:gothamgal”. Brad Feld noticed this, and liked it, and posted here that he set up something similar for himself – “If you run across something on the web you want me to see, just tag it.” All of this got Josh Schachter’s attention and so he created a more structured, and private, way of doing this: “ tags for two We’ve just begun rolling out support for tagging items for others. To do so, use “for:username” where username is the name of the user you want to send the item to. You can see items tagged for you at http://del.icio.us/for/ (it’ll redirect to your own page, which other users will not be able to see.)” Link Brad Feld then posted an update to his original request here . So, bottom line, any delicious user can now have a private recommendation tag. To recommend stuff to me, tag it “for:marrington” and I will be able to view it at ” http://del.icio.us/for/marrington” (although this will not be public). It’s a nice feature, although I would like an option to make it public. I think it would be interesting to share these recommendations with everyone. There are also concerns being expressed about spamming incentives. Over time, I can see “blacklists” being created for “bad users”, although it would be easy for people to simply create new delicious accounts.

,Profile – Newsgator Online V. Bloglines,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/08/profile-newsgator-online-v-bloglines/,"Editor’s Note: This is a profile of NewsGator’s online product only, not its outlook, feeddemon and other products. There is a natural tendency to view NewsGator Online in comparison to Bloglines, as the products are both very popular and similar in many ways. Company:  NewsGator Founded: 2003. Acquired Feeddemon in May 2005. What is it? This profile reviews only NewsGator’s online product . NewsGator has a number of other popular products, including an Outlook product and the products offered by Feeddemon (recently acquired by NewsGator). We will probably profile NewsGator’s other products soon. They’ve recently changed their pricing structure , and based on its complexity (and user feedback), we suspect things may be further simplified over time. Today, Nick Bradbury (Feeddemon founder) further changed pricing for his product. The reason we like the Online edition is that it is not tied to a single computer. You can log in from anywhere. Also, Bloglines is the gold standard of web-based RSS readers , and it is natural to compare and contrast the two services (see our Blogines profile here ) Key Features of NewsGator Online: – easy import of feeds opml file – two pane interface – clippings, folders and feeds on the left, content on the right (similar to bloglines) – alphabetizes feeds – can view all feeds, or just feeds with new content – fast updating – great “clipping” tool to save content with one click – sorting options includ by date, view older/newer first – nascent search abilities NewsGator v. Bloglines: Bloglines has recently had significant delays in updating feeds – often updating only once a week. That means content comes infrequently and is stale – just the opposite of the core reason for using an RSS reader.  Their site is also down quite often (who’s seen the infamous Bloglines Plumber recently?) They are the largest RSS reader (other than Yahoo) (Bloglines accounts for about 30% of Techcrunch subscriptions, NewsGator is a close second), but these problems are leading many users to try out other services. However, even with its shortcoming, we find that NewsGator Online is not as good as Bloglines (but it’s close). To test NewsGator, we imported our Bloglines feeds and used it exclusively for a few days. Importing was easy, thanks to the Bloglines export feature and the NewsGator import feature. Snafus are noted below. Things NewsGator does better than Bloglines: 1. Feeds are updated much more frequently on NewsGator (a very, very important feature). 2. While both services have a “clippings” feature, we found NewsGator’s to be much easier to use – one click. Also, the clippings folder is added to the main directory on the left pane, whereas bloglines has an additional tab to click to view clipped items. 3. If you want a PC or Mac based desktop client, you have the ability to sync feeds with that client so you don’t read the same content twice (Bloglines doesn’t offer a desktop service). 4. NewsGator was never down during our testing period. Bloglines is down frequently. Things Bloglines does better than NewsGator: 1. Both have two pane interfaces, but Bloglines allows scrolling of the left pane whereas NewsGator doesn’t. This means that you can peruse feeds without losing the content in the right pane. This seems like a small issue, but we found it really annoying when using NewsGator. 2. Bloglines has a “mark all read” feature that clears out all unread content. NewsGator doesn’t have this feature, meaning we had to click on each and every one of our 250+ feeds after importing the opml file to clear out old content. This was a one-time issue, but it certainly got us off on the wrong foot with regard to our NewsGator experience. 3. Both services alphabetize feeds. However, Bloglines disregards “the” before the feedname, and we found it difficult to find the feeds we were used to reading by the name we remembered them by. 4.  Bloglines shows the number of subscribers for each feed, and you can view public subscribers. NewsGator doesn’t do this. 5. Bloglines allows you to view public subscriptions of other users (and add them to your own). NewsGator doesn’t have this feature. Bloglines also has a permanent URI for each subscriber’s public feeds. As an example, here are all of my personal feeds on Bloglines. 6.  Bloglines has a “keep new” feature for each post that is useful. NewsGator has no equivalent feature. 7. Bloglines has a useful but little known about email feature – you can create an email address and all emails to that address show up as a feed in bloglines. It’s very useful for subscribing to newsletter type emails that you’d rather have in your RSS reader than your email inbox. Things Both do well: Both have great user interfaces, options to open content in a new window or the existing window, options for folders to group feeds and good customer service (inquiries about both were answered promptly, within 24 hours even over a weekend). Neither service has tagging of content, something Rojo ( Rojo profile ) has, and we’d like to see further experiments in this area. Summary: To be honest, we could be happy with either one. But if forced to choose, we choose Bloglines based on features available today. If the feed updating issue isn’t worked out, however, or if we see that damn bloglines plumber more than once a month, things may change quickly. NewsGator has a good track record of responding quickly to user feedback, and most of the blogines features mentioned here could easily be added to NewsGator. Finally, we note that with the ease of opml exports of feeds, there is no real lock-in of users, and a newcomer with fresh ideas could easily and quickly gain real market share.

,Profile – Weblogs.Com (Ping Server),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/08/profile-weblogscom-ping-server/,"Service:  Weblogs.com Launched: 1999 What is it? Weblogs.com was the first blogging ping service and remains the largest. What is a ping service? A ping service is a server that takes “pings” from blogs (and other sources). The purpose of the ping is to notify the ping server that the source has added new content. This is aggregated with other pings and, if the ping server is open, the data becomes available to third parties. The third parties are able to access the URI of the source and the time of the ping. Ping services are not discussed very often. There’s not much to look at (the action is in the xml data), and to date they haven’t charged for their services. However, ping servers are the backbone of the blogosphere infrastructure and are a crucially important piece of the real-time web. Here’s why: Ping servers sit between search engines and blogs. Without ping servers, search engines like feedster, technorati and pubsub would not know if and when blogs and other content sources updated. They would regularly have to index these sites to find out if they’ve updated. With over 10,000,000 blogs, re-indexing every hour would be a massive undertaking – every few minutes, impossible. Instead, they re-index only when a source notifies the ping server that it has updated. It is a much more efficient way for the real-time web to keep “real-time” with only a few minute delay between posting and indexing. There are many ping servers today (see links below for lists), but Weblogs.com was the first and is by far the largest, as it is built into nearly all blogging software. Weblogs.com: Dave Winer created Weblogs.com in 1999 as a service to index weblogs. He re-launched it as a ping server in November 2001 (see also here ) as blogs started to grow beyond the point where it was feasible to re-index them regularly. Today Weblogs.com is receiving over 1,000,000 pings per day ( link ). Weblogs.com has an open back end and allows anyone to access its data. Using Weblogs.com: To ping weblogs.com, a site sends a a simple XML-RPC message to rpc.weblogs.com, port 80, path /RPC2. that includes the feed name (name of blog or other source) and the URL. To access ping data, third parties can access two versions: weblogs.com/changes.xml shows data from the last hour, and weblogs.com/shortchanges.xml shows data from the last five minutes. For more complete information, see the Weblog.com XML-RPC Interface post here . Audio.Weblogs.com: audio.weblogs.com is a podcasting ping service. It is very much like weblogs.com, but it includes additional data as well: – size of podcast – xml feed of podcast – number of clicks on link (a ranking or popularity feature) Pinging and accessing audio.weblogs.com data is similar to the normal weblogs.com ping service.

,Web 2.0 This Week (July 3 – 9),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/08/web-20-this-week-july-3-9/,"This week we saw a number of interesting web 2.0 developments. Far outstripping everything else, however, was the terrorist attack on London on July 7. Blogs and the Internet played a big role in getting information out to people, as television lagged way behind and the cell networks were jammed. Weekly Summary: 1. Terrorist Attack in London I was flying to Europe for a conference, enjoying my first-ever wifi experience on a plane, when the IMs from friends in London started coming in. “There was an exposion in the tube, they think it was a power converter” one friend said. Then, a few minutes later, “Oh my God, there are reports of explosions everywhere – it may be bus bombs.” Soon I had flight attendants and other flyers coming up to me for updates. The pilot sent a flight attendant back to hear what was happening because she couldn’t get news via radio. I was the only news source on the flight, it seemed. BBC’s website went down from the traffic, and people turned to blogs for the news. Wikipedia was cited as the most up to date source of information. Others blogged about their experiences. From a big media v. blog angle, Fred Wilson summed it up perfectly when he said “This is what its all about and why CNN with its 24×7 news channel is hopelessly out of date.” (linking to Jeff Jarvis ).

Ian Davis – “Web 2.0 is an attitude not a Technology” Ian writes a wonderful essay, furthering the definition of web 2.0: “Here’s my take on it: Web 2.0 is an attitude not a technology. It’s about enabling and encouraging participation through open applications and services. By open I mean technically open with appropriate APIs but also, more importantly, socially open, with rights granted to use the content in new and exciting contexts. Of course the web has always been about participation, and would be nothing without it. It’s single greatest achievement, the networked hyperlink, encouraged participation from the start. Somehow, through the late nineties, the web lost contact with its roots and selfish interests took hold. This is why I think the Web 2.0 label is cunning: semantically it links us back to that original web and the ideals it championed, but at the same time it implies regeneration with a new version. Technology has moved on and it’s important that the social face of the web keeps pace.” 5. Read/Write Web – Technorati is gaining traction, massively “Technorati is growing at a rapid rate.

It is only available on the PC platform for now. In their own words, “The idea is simple. Itâ€™s a globe that sits inside your PC. You point and zoom to anyplace on the planet that you want to explore. Satellite images and local facts zoom into view. Tap into Google search to show local points of interest and facts. Zoom to a specific address to check out an apartment or hotel. View driving directions and even fly along your route. We invite you to try it now.”  Link “Google Earth puts a planet’s worth of imagery and other geographic information right on your desktop.

,Profile – Skype (Outlook Toolbar),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/06/profile-skype-outlook-toolbar/,"Editor’s Note: I’m currently 35,000 feet above ground level, on my way to Europe. SAS is now offering Connexion by Boeing – $30 for high-speed wireless for the whole trip. Nothing like making a call from an airplane for two cents a minute. I’m skyping and blogging my way to Europe…Heck, I’m going to profile this next. Company: Skype ( Outlook Toolbar ) Launched: July 5, 2005 (Outlook Toolbar) What is it? The basic Skype service today allows anyone with a computer to register and call/IM with any other Skype user who’s accepted them as a contact. Think of it as instant messaging with sound. And lots of people are using Skype – they have well over 100 million downloads of their client and over 1 million paying users. The network effect has kicked in big time for Skype. Skype has great core features: – free p2p calling via a “soft phone” (software on your computer instead of a telephone), with up to 4 people at a time – basic text IM capabilities – file uploading – Skype-Out (call any phone number, for a small per minute charge) – Skype-In (assign your skype account a phone number, allowing any phone to call you on your computer) – voicemail There are at least two features that would make it much more compelling – application sharing (meaning you can share powerpoint demonstrations, websites, or whatever with people on your call) (see our profile on vskype , which has this as well as video), and call record (see our profile on Gizmo , which has this feature as well as others like mapping). But in general Skype is fun, cheap and has decent sound quality. What’s the New Outlook Toolbar? The new Outlook Toolbar integrates Skype very tightly with Outlook. There is an extremely detailed profile of the product by Peter Henning at SkypeJournal as well that I recommend reading if you intend to use the product. It’s a very small download (767k for PC) and installs quickly. In a nutshell, it allows you to: – Use Skype directly from Outlook (the skype client must be running as well) – associate your Outlook contacts with their skype usernames. You can then Skype them directly from Outlook if they are online. If you get an email from them, you’ll see a skype status  icon next to their name, and you can chat or talk with them by clicking. Overall, its a nice integration between two of the most important applications on most PC user’s desktops. Another great feature, which you can see in the image above, is that it enables one-click skype-out calls to the contact’s phone numbers. This “ click to call ” feature is a killer feature. These phone numbers do not need to be separately added to your Skype-Out call list. Overall, this is a great productivity tool for heavy Skype and Outlook users.

,Profile: Tagcloud,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/05/profile-tagcloud/,"Service: TagCloud Launched: June 2005 Location: Bellwood, PA Status: Corporate name is IonZoft What is it? TagCloud is a service that generates a “tagcloud” (see below) based on provided URLs or feeds. A tagcloud is basically a grouping of tags associated with content, from a single or multiple sources. Tagclouds are a visual tool – tags used more often are bigger and/or darker than less used tags, allowing a visual representation of relative tag use. Clicking on a tag takes the user to relevant content related to the tag – basically a list of content associated with such tag (ranking is usually by date, or freshness, but this is not a requirement. TagCloud is a tool for creating tagclouds. A key fact to point out right at the start is that TagCloud uses keyword (text) analysis, not tag/category analysis, in creating the tag cloud. This is a point of contention (or at least discussion) around the service and worth noting as you read on. Here’s a visual example of a tagcloud (remember that in a real tag cloud each item is clickable and links to relevant content): The reason tagclouds are useful, instead of merely visually entertaining, is that they show in a very clear way the most popular tags and link directly to associated content. This will become increasingly important as the RSS aggregation and search applications collide in the near future (underlined because I am going to point back to this post in 2 years and say “I told you so”). If you are mathematically inclined, I highly recommend reading Pietro Speroni’s three articles on tagclouds linked to below (see Links). There really is something to this other than a neat visual trick. TagClouds is an easy to use service, and other than the contentious issue of using text/keyword analysis instead of category/tag analysis, the only problem is that they are extremely slow to generate. Since a key feature is adding these to your blog, the load time can be prohibitively long. An easy fix would be for Tagcloud to cache content periodically and present that cached (and slightly dated) content instead of re-generating the tag cloud on every html or xml call – I assume they are considering this. The speed issue is a killer and I would much prefer slightly old data instead of waiting 2-3 minutes for my blog to fully load in a browser. Key Features: – easy sign up – easy to create a cloud based on a single feed or url – easy to create a cloud based on a group of feeds – import an opml file for easy creation of a massive cloud – good tools for publishing clouds on websites – dedicated URLs for each cloud, in html and xml format – show any number of tags in the cloud, up to 250 As Pietro writes, a tag set or tagcloud for a single source of information is not very interesting. For instance, here is the tagcloud for Techcrunch only: Link (long load time) Compare this to the tagcloud for our entire opml file, with over 200 feeds of awesome blogs and other content (see list here ): Link (long load time) It is a much more interesting result set. Remember, clicking on any tag gives a result set. Here is part of the result set after clicking on the “search” tag above: Technology: Tagcloud uses Yahoo’s Content Analysis web service and simple php to put the feed information into a database, analyze it with the Yahoo tool and generate the cloud: Link Given their openness to creation of new applications using tagcloud, this can be an exciting and very useful service over time. Hint: If aggregators generated a tag cloud for all of my unread content every day, it would be much easier for me to peruse posts that I am interested in. This can solve the overload problem we are all facing as we try to track more and more feeds daily (reading over 200 daily feeds takes me at least 2-3 hours per day right now). What I would like to see is a tag cloud based on tags and keywords.

,Profile: Dinnerbuzz,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/03/profile-dinnerbuzz/,"Company:  Dinnerbuzz Launched: June 2005 What is it? Dinnerbuzz is a new service that allows users to provide feedback on restaurants, bars and coffee shops. It leverages user-provided metadata (including tagging) to allow others to easily find and read content on restaurants. In their own words, “Dinnerbuzz is designed to make it easier for you to find a place for dinner (and drinks) (or coffee). It’s a social guide to restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. When you post, your tags are shared with everyone. Tags make it easy to find places you might not have known about before. And since Dinnerbuzz enables you to filter tags locally, finding interesting places (and people) has never been quicker!”  Link So, what we have with Dinnerbuzz is a new social networking site that leverages user tagging. tangent begins… We note two emerging trends in the web 2.0 space. The first trend is the huge proliferation of new social networks/tagging services and the difficulty as a user in keeping up.  The second trend is the “problem” with user tagging. With regard to the first trend, we’ve all been thinking about it, and John Battelle pointed it out in a recent post (discussed here previously) – “it’s a pain in the ass to keep creating social networks, maintaining groups, tagging, sharing, etc. It’s a habit I’m not sure the masses will ever get into, at least in a way that is driven by pure selflessness.” The second trend is the “problem” with user tagging. People need an incentive or they just won’t do it (see our profiles on CelebrityFlicker and feedster – “if a web 2.0 service is going to add user tagging, especially anonymous user tagging, they better provide one heck of a good incentive for users to do it (see Delicious, Furl, etc.) or else they will get bad data.” ) These will sort themselves out over time, with winners and losers, but new companies thinking of adding these features, or basing themselves on them, need to think forward or risk being a loser. Back to Dinnerbuzz: Is there an incentive for user tagging? We’ll wait and see. …tangent ends Reader Experience: Anyone can search Dinnerbuzz for restaurants and read reviews. There are a number of great search options. Every city has a set page, and from there searches can be done by tag (like “mexican”) and/or rating (up to 10). Once a sufficient number of restaurants have been rated in a city, it could be a very useful way of searching for a good new restaurant. RSS feeds are available for everything, from monitoring a single city, restaurant or user’s reviews, to reading new reviews as they come in. For instance, you can see our profile and reviews here (we really, really like El Tarasco in Manhattan Beach – I’m trying to figure out an angle where I can call it “web 2.0” and profile it here :-)) and there is a big fat XML button right there in the middle of the page. This is all very well done. Publisher Experience: Once you’ve registered (simple, no captcha or email verification), you can post your own reviews. The first step is typing in the restaurant name and location. Dinnerbuzz uses the yahoo mapping api for local search. Submitting a restaurant consists of entering its name and location, adding tags and comments (free text) and rating it from 1-10: If Dinnerbuzz can’t find a perfect match for your restaurant it suggests a few close matches. If there are no close matches, there is an option to add a location. Overall, adding and reviewing a restaurant is a good experience for US locations, but there are two problems (one easily fixed). First, the options include all yahoo local search options, so you see real estate brokers, plumbers, dentists, etc. for close matches (no idea if this is “fixable” within the Yahoo api constraints). Second, if there are close matches, there is no “add” button if one of the matches isn’t correct (easy to add this). Key Features: – great integration with Yahoo Local data – search by tag, rating or tag+ rating – every city has a city page, users can then sort by tag and/or rating – easy submit of new location – publishers can add new location if no match with Yahoo Local – RSS everywhere (yeah!) Needed Fixes/Features: – ability to add or delete entries – expand “add” functionality when there are close matches (not just no match) – add friends and see/subscribe to their reviews – fix non-restaurant data in close matches Dinnerbuzz is a cool experiment and most of its obvious flaws are easily fixed (and they are adding features) If they can tie it in with other social networking services it could become a very useful service over time.

Many of you may read Richard  MacManus’ excellent web 2.0 Weekly Wrapup at his site ( link ). Richard, don’t think of this as stealing your idea. Rather, please consider our relatively poor imitation as a very sincere form of flattery. :-) Weekly Summary: 1. We’re off to the races…the first RSS focused VC fund is announced–$100m  “Jim Moore and John Palfrey have launched RSS Investors with $100m of capital. It is the first VC fund with a focus on Really Simple Syndication, (RSS), the syndication technology at the heart of media technologies such as blogging and corporate news communication.” More info on the fund here . 2. O’Reilly: Web 2.0 to be built on the backs of hackers “Tim O’Reilly spoke today at Where 2.0 about the merits of holding a confab focused on mapping and location based technologies and framed it in the context of the emergence of a new platform, Web 2.0.” “Google maps with Craigslist is the first true Web 2.0 application, neither of the sites was involvedâ€¦a developer put it together,” he said. “Hackers are teaching the industry what to do.” 3. Troy Angrignon – Shifting paradigms: The mental evolutionary process of moving from web 1.0 to web 2.0 in 17 steps This is an excellent essay that Troy wrote that describes the natural evolution of a site from web 1.0 to web 2.0. 4. Vertical LEAP: the SDForum Search Engine Conference The Vertical Leap conference was held on Tuesday, June 28 and was a must-attend event for those interested in search and web 2.0. Techcrunch profile here . 5. Nick Bradbury: Microsoft, RSS and Attention “One of the most powerful things about RSS is that it breaks information into individual items – bite-size chunks, if you like – which theoretically enables tools and services to find out what you’re paying attention to. The more that’s known about what you’re paying attention to, the more relevant information the service can automatically provide for you (and the more irrelevant information the service can automatically discard).” Our discussion of the Microsoft announcement is here . Their announcement is a big deal. And so is attention.xml (or at least it can be). 6. Robert X. Cringely: The Supreme Court This Week Unknowingly Pushed Us All Toward Web 2.0 “But the studios are wrong if they also think that this decision means the end for illegal file sharing. For that matter, the Supreme Court may view it that way, too, and they’d also be wrong. All it has done is change the game, accelerating a trend that was already inevitable — the transition to Web 2.0.” 7. Itâ€™s a great time to be an entrepreneur “Excite.com took $3,000,000 to get from idea to launch. JotSpot took $100,000.” 8. Social Networks: The Network or the Service? “But as the number of social networks and connection-services grows, the likelihood of achieving the necessary critical mass for each one diminishes.” 9.

,Profile: Gizmo,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/01/profile-gizmo/,"Company:  Gizmo <img src='http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/gizmologo.gif' alt='' border=1 / Launched: June 30, 2005 What is it? Gizmo is like skype but is built on open source. It’s available for Mac and Windows (3.1 mb download on windows), with a Linux version promised in August. A problem with Skype is that it is a closed silo – it will not interconnect with other VOIP systems. Gizmo, however, is built on the open source, standards-based net calling program built by SIPphone . According to Gizmo, there are over 100 applications peering with SIPphone technology ( link ). Gizmo has nearly every feature that Skype has, plus a few really cool things Skype doesn’t do. It does lack instant messaging, however. Once it has that, it will be superior to what Skype offers today, and at a much lower price. Here is a feature-by-feature comparison: Link We tested a call earlier today and the quality was on par or better than Skype. The user interface is slick and very much what people are used to seeing with Skype and IM clients: There is no set limit to the number of callers, but they recommend only 4 (or more if people are on mute): “Technically, there is no limit to the number of people that can conference call together on the Gizmo Project system.

Userplane is an application service provider to web 2.0 companies. They offer a suite of easy-to-integrate services, built on the flash platform, including chat , group chat , a webrecoder and, soon, a sitesearch product. Typical Userplane customers are dating and social networking sites (any site that has users who would like to interact and/or create profiles that include audio/video content). The applications are polished, intuitive and fun to use. In their own words, “Userplane is the premier provider of enterprise social software for online communities. Userplane Apps are easy to use, rapidly deployed Flash web applications that support live text and audio/video communication. The application suite consists of three apps that each add core, must-have features to thriving community websites: Userplane Webrecorder enables users to record and share audio/video messages, Userplane Webmessenger provides live text and audio/video instant messaging, and Userplane Webchat delivers full-featured, multi-room, multi-user text and A/V chatting.

,Profile: Vertical Leap Conference,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/30/profile-vertical-leap-conference/,"Event:  Vertical Leap Date: Tuesday, June 28 2005,  9:00 AM – 5:30 PM What was it? Vertical Leap was an exceptional one-day conference held in the heart of Silicon Valley earlier this week, hosted by Jeff Clavier and Dave McClure . In their own words, “A whole new crop of venture-funded startups focused on vertical search are beginning to enter the field and draw attention. Search is going Vertical — vertical search engines are available for local businesses, product & shopping search, travel search, weblog & news search, and search for classified & jobs listings, with more domain-specific search engines debuting every month.” The event focused on search, obviously, and web 2.0 themes were prevalent throughout. The event was very well blogged and we’ve linked to many of the posts below. All of the segments were interesting and well organized. A key focus was on investments in this space, of course, and the technology and customer approaches needed to dominate in niche search areas. The most interesting segment from our perspective was on news/blog search. The panel was moderated by Om Malik (with Steve Gillmor stepping in at the beginning because Om was late). In our opinion the seating of the panelists was symbolic when thinking about their companies from a web 2.0 perspective. Left to right, you had Chris Tolles (Topix.net), Jim Pitkow (moreover), Scott Rafer (feedster), Tantek Celik (technorati), and Om Malik. From the discussion it was very clear who “got” web 2.0 and who didn’t. As you went from left to right, the panelists were more focused on web 2.0, peaking with Om (I overheard a comment after the panel from an audience member that said “they spent more time on Om’s blog than on all of the others’ sites combined”). :-) Om kept asking questions that the others just couldn’t answer about user interfaces, search relevance and tagging. Chris, at the web 1.0 end of the table, wasn’t keen on RSS and tagging, and stated repeatedly that Topix.net went for the “wow” factor in deciding where to place content. “People want to hear about murders and bankruptcies, not companies making their numbers”, said Chris when asked about search relevance. Scott and Tantik just shook their heads, as did most of the audience.  Om looked away towards the audience and chuckled. That being said, topix.net is an awesome site and after sifting through their 250 RSS feeds I found a great one and subscribed. There is a fundamental shift going on in the Internet, and some people speak the new language. Others simply hear gibberish. Overall, a wonderful conference, terrific networking event, and plenty of coffee was available all day. Thanks Jeff and Dave for putting on a terrific conference.

Norwegian hacker cracks Google software A Norwegian guy took one day to crack Google’s new video viewer so that it plays video from any server, which is what VLC originally did. This is what Google should have done in the first place anyway. “The Norwegian who became a hacker hero for developing software to unlock copy-protection codes on DVD movies said he needed only one day to crack Google Inc.’s new video viewer. Jon Lech Johansen, also known as DVD Jon, posted software on his “So Sue Me” Web site that he says modifies the viewer so that it plays videos hosted on any server. The company’s Google Video Viewer, in turn, was modified from the free VLC media player to restrict it to playing video hosted on Google’s own servers.

,Profile: Feedster,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/29/profile-feedster/,"Company:  Feedster Founded: March 2003 Status: Founded by Scott Johnson in March 2003. Merged with RSS-Search founded by FranÃ§ois Schiettecatte in June 2003. Announced Series A funding on June 2, 2005 led by Selby Venture Partners.

Link Location: Feedster, Inc. 116 New Montgomery Street Suite 605 San Francisco, CA 94105 Voice: 415-348-9119 Email: info@feedster.com What is it? Feedster is one of the original real-time search engines, and has added interesting new services along the way to further evolve the web 2.0.  The services we will profile are search, link search and their new user tagging feature. They also have a nascent RSS reader and other services (like “feedpaper” (which we just can’t figure out), job search, and feed search for sites. Most of these other features are available under advanced search and My Feedster . In their own words, â€œFeedster is first and foremost a search engine, however unlike a general web search engine like Google, Feedster includes only a certain type of content, called feeds, which provide many advantages.ï¿½? â€œFeedster is a rapidly growing Internet search engine and advertising network that provides timely and meaningful information to consumers and large Internet sites in need of targeted media.  Feedster provides a fresh index across over 8 million feeds several times per hour, adding millions of new documents daily. Feedster benefits from the ways that blogging is changing the Internetâ€™s basic building blocks â€“ from unstructured web pages to structured documents.ï¿½? A slight tangent starts here…. While attending the vertical leap conference on search yesterday (we will post about this event separately),  a lot of questions came up regarding “old search” v. “new search”. Old search (the gold standard is Google) prioritizes results based on “relevance”, which is largely determined based on links into the content. Lots of links =  high relevance (this is simplified of course). With real-time search (blogging, news, etc.), link analysis breaks because there is not sufficient time for links to materialize and become indexed. Real-Time search engines like Feedster and Technorati (Profiles here ) generally use “freshness” as the determining factor of relevance. The most recent post including your searched keyword or tag is placed first in the results. For Real-Time search to have its “ah-ha!” moment, these services must figure out a better way of adding relevance to results. This can be as simple as putting new content from highly linked blogs higher in search results (although this may tend to “lock in” older blogs), to creating highly complicated algorithms to determine relevancy of a given publisher to the particular content (so boingboing, the most popular blog, wouldn’t necessarily be given higher relevance if they posted on a new biotech company, something they don’t generally cover). …tangent ends Feedster Search: Feedster search is good but not as good as Technorati is today. The reasons: integration of publisher tags into technorati results, and the fact that Technorati adds delicious, furl, buzznet and delicious tags to their results (see here for instance).  Feedster doesn’t do this (yet?) and so the results aren’t as useful (same search at Feedster here ). Feedster search is, however, quite useful and has a very clean interface (something Technorati is criticized for). Feedster also has a toggle to show results by “Date” or “Relevance”, which is great, although relevance seems to be powered mostly by keyword counting at this point. Screen shots of Feedster Search interface and results: Feedster Link Search: Feedster also has an excellent feature that shows link coming in to a particular URI. It’s useful for research and ego-searches, and generally to see who’s linking to what. The interface is very similar to general search. Screen Shots for Feedster Link Search: Feedster Tagging: This is the really interesting new thing happening at Feedster. (note our editorial comments on the benefits and perils of user tagging in a recent profile of Celebrity Flicker – in general, you need to find a really good incentive for users to tag (see Delicious and Furl) or you end up with bad results). Feedster tagging was announced by Scott Rafer, Feedster’s CEO, in a personal blog post on May 19, 2005 ( link ). The idea is to add a “Tag this” button at the end of a blog post where users can tag the post as they wish. The code to add this is available here (just do a view source on the page). You must be a feedster registered user and go through a captcha process to insert a tag. Here is the process visually (last one is the code needed to insert it into a blog): Feedster Tagging Screen Shots: This is an interesting and ongoing experiment with user tagging. However, currently the tagging results are useful for only one thing: viewing all tags for a post once you’ve added a tag. For now, the results are not integrated into Feedster search or anywhere else, and so there is almost no incentive for a user to tag content in any meaningful way. Thus, tags like “asshat” and “qrp2” appear within the results. Not good. I spoke to Scott Rafer about this issue yesterday and he says that they will roll out additional functionality in the future, including support for scuttle , the open source “delicious” bookmarking service. That will certainly help. But for now, the experiment shows that user tagging absulutely requires incentives or else users will not tag, and/or will not tag appropriately. We’ve added the “tag this” feature to this post as an experiment to see what kind of data is generated. Have at it!

,Profile: Rainy Daze,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/29/profile-rainy-daze/,"Editor’s Note: This is about Rainy Daze, but it’s also about the evolution of web 1.0 to web 2.0 and Rainy Daze is a useful conduit for this discussion. Company:  Rainy Daze Why is Rainy Daze being Profiled on Techcrunch? Rainy Daze is NOT web 2.0. It screams web 1.0. But there is a reason why its here. I read an article today (referred from What’s Web 2.0? ) that was written by Troy Angrinon called “Shifting paradigms: The mental evolutionary process of moving from web 1.0 to web 2.0 in 17 steps” ( Link ) (and who, I note, writes with Qumana ( profile ). The article was originally an email to a friend, and Troy decided to post it to his blog. TechCrunch exists, partially, for similar reasons. We were being asked by friends about web 2.0 and the companies and products that define it, constantly, and so we decided to blog about them instead. Blogging about interesting stuff is just so much easier than having lots and lots of one-on-one conversations. Troy’s article reminded me of a post from last year by Fred Wilson called Blogging 1.0 .  It is a must read for any friends that ask you why blogging is different from geocities. I wrote about the article in my personal blog, adding a few things that I thought were important (how blogging is possible because of better software (Troy talks about this) and how they leverage the network effect). So why Rainy Daze? Last week Keith Teare and I were at Gnomedex, and staying up in town called Anacortes on an island north of Seattle. One evening at dinner we met a local couple (Keri and Jonathan) who were very nice and listened to us discuss the significance of that day’s Microsoft announcement of their support for RSS and how it was important, really important, to the evolution of the web. They were interested (really!?) and seemed to wanted to understand how all the new technology would affect them. And then they told us about Rainy Daze, a website they run from their home and where they sell hand made soaps and other bath stuff. I believe that someday soon, sites like Rainy Daze will incorporate web 2.0 features, probably from companies we’ve profiled or will profile here at Techcrunch. I also believe that it’s important to think about sites like these, because ultimately the stuff we are doing today will affect people’s lives. What is it? Rainy Daze has very cool stuff. In their own words, “Rainy Daze began with the idea of creating and enhancing all-natural skin care products with the wonderful scent of essential oils. Our products are a welcome change from commercially manufactured products because they are handcrafted using ingredients you can recognize, such as silk. Adding silk creates a soap rich in moisture, leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth. We also add moisturizing oils such as jojoba, sweet almond, avocado, hemp seed and shea and cocoa butters creating an incredible hydrating effect. In keeping with our natural approach, we avoid unnecessary colors and additives. We choose only the finest ingredients and pride ourselves on providing you with a top-notch quality product. In 1999 we began making soap as gifts for friends and family. Because of the requests for replacements, we envisioned an opportunity for growth and fine-tuned our process in order to turn our hobby into a business. Soap making is the creative outlet that has brought inspiration into our lives and given us the opportunity to work with our hands. We are excited about our product line and absolutely love what we do!” I’ve bought some of their products (lots of their products actually) for my parents as a housewarming gift in their new home on the island. It’s awesome. I recommend you check it out. I imagine they will have a blog very soon to talk about what they are doing. I hope this post, and Troy’s essay linked above, will be helpful to them in doing so. Screen Shot: Tags: ecommerce , advertising , web2.0 , techcrunch",,2005-06-29 00:00:00
,Profile: Yahoo My Web 2.0,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/29/profile-yahoo-my-web-20/,"Service: Yahoo My Web 2.0 Launched: June 29, 2005 What is it? MyWeb2.0 is a social search engine “that complements web search by enabling users to search the knowledge and expertise of their friends and community in addition to the web.” We’ve used and abused it for a day, and in our opinion it’s good – a bit like regular yahoo plus furl ( profile ). It was launched today as an early beta version “for a limited number of users.” There could be a cutoff, so it’s a good idea to sign up soon if you want an early look (what a great marketing idea). Once you sign up (you can use an existing yahoo account), you can do a number of things. If you want to bookmark web pages, we recommend downloading the yahoo toolbar, which will allow you to bookmark pages you are browsing. Otherwise, you can only bookmark pages found on normal Yahoo search.  We don’t like toolbars very much because nearly half our screen is taken up with them, but if you want to use MyWeb2.0 it’s going to have to be a part of your life (and hey, maybe you already use the Yahoo toolbar). When you bookmark a page a popup appears that allows you to enter meta-data on the site, including title, notes, tags, access controls and a “save page” option (again, all of this looks and feels very much like furl: You can also invite friends (feel free to add us – archimedesventures@yahoo.com) (techcrunch was taken :-)), and see their bookmarked pages. The whole idea is that stuff that is relevant to your friends, could very well be relevant to you, too. This is user tagging in action (see our profiles on Celebrity Flicker and Feedster for a discussion of the perils of this), but here you have real incentives (like delicious and furl) to do it properly – both to find stuff later and to share with your friends. Yes, it is yet another service to add friends and go to the trouble of bookmarking sites, but it does have in inport option (including RSS feeds) (yeah!)  to decrease the burden. I imported my personal delicious page RSS feed and it seemed to work reasonably well. There’s a ton thats been written about this (see links below), so our recommendation is try read the reviews and try it out for yourself. Thanks, Yahoo, for launching this experiment in Web 2.0.

,Profile: Itunes 4.9,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/28/profile-itunes-49/,"Service:  iTunes 4.9 with Podcasts Launched: June 28, 2005 What is it? As was widely anticipated, iTunes 4.9 launched today (22 mb download) for both windows and mac platforms. It includes significant new and enhanced features, including, most notably, support for podcasts. Michael Gartenberg writes a wonderful post on iTunes 4.9: “I can download one, subscribe to a feed, keep a set number on my device and have them automatically deleted after I’ve listened. In short Apple’s done for podcasting the same thing they did with RSS in Tiger. They made it usable by the mass markets and at the same time, they have the what is going to be the most widely used podcasting client on both Macintosh and Windows and that will make their directory the one to be listed in. But there’s more. Apple also tweaked the firmware in all the iPod so there’s no a separate podcasting category, which means podcasts won’t get shuffled with my music and will support bookmarks so I can listen to podcasts and resume where I left off. So it’s not just the premier podcast PC client, the iPod itself is now first among devices with integrated podcast support. Combine this news and the new pricing and the integration of iPod photo into the core white iPod line and you see why Apple remains the player to beat in this space.” The software is excellent and includes notable features: – all podcasts are currently free – downloaded podcasts show up in a single iTunes folder called “podcasts” – easy search/find – one click subscription to a new podcast – option to have all future podcasts download automatically – Tools for submitting publisher podcasts on iTunes – stays separate in iPod, so not shuffled with music – autodelete after listening (awesome!)

,Profile: Celebrity Flicker,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/27/profile-celebrity-flicker/,"Company:  Celebrity Flicker Launched: May 2005 What is it? Celebrity Flicker is a website that posts pictures of celebrities and related images (movie art, etc.).  The site isn’t very deep and appears to focus on less-than-fully-dressed women, so it isn’t exactly an imdb.com replacement. However, it has a single interesting feature that makes it web 2.0 relevant – anonymous tagging by users. When you view a particular picture, tags that users have added appear next to the picture, along with an “Add Tag!” button: Link This is meaningful because it is one of the first experiments in anonymous user tagging of content on a site in order to relate one piece of content to other pieces. In the above screen shots, the user-generated tags next to the Trainspotting picture are: * heroin * life * choose * actress * macdonald * kelly * trainspotting Each of these tags link to other pictures that have been tagged identically by other users. This means that the site is using its users to make its content more easily findable. For instance, if you click on the “trainspotting” link, you get this page: Link Most results aren’t as relevant as this one though. A big issue with user tagging is generating real v. useless results. We’ll write more on this later in a post we are writing about the recently released Feedster anonymous tagging feature. With Delicious, users have a real incentive to tag properly – so that they can find the content again later via searching or browsing of their tags. With celebrity flicker that incentive is significantly less powerful and so the results are significantly less significant. What does this prove? It means that if a web 2.0 service is going to add user tagging, especially anonymous user tagging, they better provide one heck of a good incentive for users to do it (see Delicious, Furl, etc.) or else they will get bad data. What about publisher tagging? Publisher tagging is a different animal. As an example of publisher tagging, see the tags we’ve added to this post at the very end. This helps real-time search engines like technorati, pubub, feedster and others quickly index posts in a contextual way and relate it to similar content (which publishers want and so they have an incentive to do it and do it properly). Further, the links below allow readers of this post to click (in our case to technorati) to see similarly tagged content if they are interested in the subject.

The main features are: * In-browser handling of del.icio.us bookmarks (tested up to 12,000 records) * Find-as-you-type searching of all your bookmarks, with basic search operators * Sort by description, tags, or timestamp * Ad-hoc tag browser”  Link It is easy to install and is a wonderful interface for Delicious.

PodShow.com is part of a family of companies/shows under Boku Communications , which was founded in 2004 by Adam Curry and Ron Bloom. Boku Communications : PodShow.com iPodder.org Daily Source Code PodShow on Sirius Radio These companies each do different things: PodShow.com: PodShow.com looks to be the main brand for the network of companies. It is currently mostly an information site, with additional features to be launched in the summer 2005. It has different sections for podcasters and for listeners: For Podcasters : This area of the site gives information on how to produce and promote a show, as well as getting it featured in the Sirius and/or PodShow network. I imagine future releases will have additional tools and features, but for now links include iPodder.org and Podcast Alley . For Listeners : This area of the site gives listeners basic information on podcasts and how to find and listen to shows.  On the home page there is also a nice flash tool to listen to PodShow’s featured shows directly (no downloading from here though): iPodder: iPodder.org is a site that gives good basic information on podcasting and also has a nice podcast directory and tool for downloading podcasts and getting them on portable music players. This is a functional site and I imagine it will become part of the overall PodShow architecture and brand. Daily Source Code: DailySourceCode.com is Adam Curry’s daily audio blog. Here you can download and/or listen to Adam’s daily thoughts on…everything. For instance, today’s show can be heard here . Check it out. It’s awesome and always a fun listen. It’s currently the most popular podcast show with Dave Winer’s Morning Coffee Notes a close second. Link Sirius Radio Show : Adam also has a weekday radio show on Sirius Radio . “Adam Curryâ€™s PodShow can be heard weekdays from 6 pm to 10 pm ET on SIRIUS Talk Central // Ch. 148. The four-hour, weekday show covers every aspect of the podcasting revolution â€” from talk to comedy to music â€” and introduce listeners to undiscovered artists from around the world…Along with podcastingâ€™s best talk, comedy and music, Adam Curryâ€™s PodShow lets listeners provide feedback, helping to shape the showâ€™s format on an ongoing basis.” How will all of this come together? We have no idea, but we look forward to future releases! “ Stay tuned for more updates and features as we ramp up for our launch this summer. “ Yup, we definitely will. There are major differences between this group of companies and the other podcast directories and services (see, for instance, Odeo – our profiles here ). The primary difference is that Podshow owns the most popular podcast in the world, and is run by a celebrity (and nice guy) – Adam Curry. So, do they have a chance against (or to work with) the upcoming iTunes 4.9? Yes, of course – and by the way, Adam Curry was featured in Apple CEO Steve Jobs keynote address at the WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) from San Franciscoâ€™s Moscone West on June 9.

,Profile: Buzznet,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/23/profile-buzznet/,"Company:  BuzzNet Founded: March 2003 Location: Buzznet, Inc. 2404 Wilshire Blvd. #11b Los Angeles, CA 90057 (213) 252-8999 phone (213) 252-8955 fax What is it? BuzzNet is a photo-sharing community. It’s hard to talk about BuzzNet without comparing and contrasting it to Flickr. It shares most or all of Flickr’s strengths, and has a few additional features as well. It’s these additional features that make it better, in my opinion, both for casual and/or “mobile” users as well as serious photographers looking for a way to share their work. I’ll explain why below. First, the basics. You can check out a quick tour here that shows how it all works.  Sign up for a free BuzzNet account and you can upload photos directly to their website, or email photos with a unique email address that contains a keyword you choose. This allows for easy mobile photoblogging – just snap a picture with your phone and have it up on your photoblog in seconds. Pictures can be tagged (they call it “buzzwords”) by you and anyone else (Flickr only allows tagging by you and your friends). Users can search/browse by these tags, and they are indexed at Technorati as well and thumbnails are shown for technorati searches for those tags. See, for instance, a technorati tag search on “Seattle” and check out the BuzzNet and Flickr photos on the right. Every user has a unique URL for their pictures, comments and profile information. You can see the Techcrunch photoblog at techcrunch.buzznet.com . For infinitely cooler photoblogs, check out some of the featured ones on the home page . For example, a guy named Adam Richman, who recorded an album in his parents’ basement in Pennsylvania, is photoblogging while on tour. Link Uploading pictures is easy, and here’s the part that I like better than Flickr: Instead of limiting the amount of upload capacity (20 megs per month at Flickr), BuzzNet only limits the number of total photos you can upload per month (just increased from 60 to 120 on the free account). Why is this important? Here’s why – With Flickr I have to take time to resize photos so that I don’t immediately use up my monthly allotment with just ten 2 mb pictures. At BuzzNet, I just send in the big file and they resize for me. And a little known fact (told to me by Marc Brown, the co-founder and President), is that the original, full size image is stored for me by BuzzNet – a killer archive tool for serious photographers and it will allow them to offer high-quality printing services in the future (just click a button and they can create a bound album and send it to you). BuzzNet seems to have more “buzz” around photos than Flickr as well. Marc tells me that, of those photos with comments, there are an average of five comments, higher than Flickr. Since BuzzNet has deeper profiling of users than Flickr, it seems obvious that more social networking will occur. Additional Features: – easy posting – unique URL for every user – RSS feed for every user page – commenting on pictures (with user settings) – easy tagging – generous free account features – 120 photos per month – easy to invite friends to join – get three friends to join and they’lll upgrade your account to a premium subscription for a full year – Buddy list – Trackbacks (who links to you) – Bookmarks (your favorite photos on Buzznet) – Favorite communities and Buzzwords/tags – Private messaging â€“ like web-based email – Custom design templates – Share Photos: e-mail photo to a friend – Statistics:  page views, and other stats Additional Screen Shots: Management: Marc Brown – Co-founder, President Anthony Batt – Co-founder Steve Haldane – Director of Technology Rich Lee – Art Director Relevant Links: about Press, media Corporate Site Faq On Technorati adding BuzzNet pics Technorati Tag: Buzznet Bitsplitter on buzznet v. flickr Om Malik on buzznet Furl Search on Buzznet Tags: buzznet , flickr , web2.0 , techcrunch , photos , photoblogging",,2005-06-23 00:00:00

Bloglines is a free, web based RSS reader. It’s the most popular, with NewsGator/Feeddemon a close second by number of users. If you are new to RSS, Bloglines is a very good place to start (for a complete list of web-based RSS readers, see here ). Bloglines has a “two pane” format, with folders and feeds listed on the left (bolded if there are new unread entries), and content from the selected feed shown at the right. If you read content from a lot of sites, this is an excellent way to organize information. It’s also very similar  to the interface for most email applications, so its familiar to most people right from the start: Signing up at Bloglines is very easy. All they ask for is an email address and password: Once you are a member, you have a variety of great tools. Key Features: – add feeds of your favorite websites (cut and paste, or add a button to your browser toolbar to auto-add any site you are on that has a feed) – easy import and export of feeds via opml file – create folders to organize content – see the number of total subscribers for any feed, and see usernames of public subscribers – add in feeds from any other subscriber (if you like their content) There is also a very neat feature that isn’t discussed very often. You can create a bloglines email address. Any email sent to this address appears within your feeds. This is a great way to move newsletters and other interesting content from your inbox to bloglines. Clearly bloglines is adding tools and features to make it useful as a portal/inbox. They’re adding things like “weather” to further this goal. Overall, we like bloglines over other current web-based RSS readers, although we’d love to see a tagging tool like Rojo (Rojo profile here ). You can see public feeds for any user at bloglines.com/public/[username]. For instance, my public feeds are viewable at bloglines.com/public/michaelarrington .

,Profile: Sxip,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/22/profile-sxip/,"Company:  Sxip Founded: October 2003 Location: Vancouver, BC, Canada What is it? The Sxip Network (“sxip” is pronounced “skip”) is an identity management registry for both users and websites/services/ASPs. They have presented at SuperNova conference and have generated lots of discussion. This is a single-sign-on solution. Think Passport, but decentralized and you don’t have to trust Microsoft to store and distribute your data. Think of this as the Verisign (domain names) of identity. As a user, if you see a sxip button on a website, you can click it and give permission for sxip to transmit some of your personal data to the website instead of re-filling out those endless forms. You can create different identities with Sxip – say personal and work – and decide who gets what information. If you aren’t yet part of Sxip, you will be presented with the option of joining when you click the Sxip button. What this means – if websites adopt this you will not need to fill out registration forms or have different credentials (usernames and passwords) for each of these sites. Sxip is going about this the right way. The platform is based “on a network architecture similar to DNS”, and includes the following participants: Users: Registered Sxip Network users who communicate with the Network via their browser. Homesites: Websites that store user data and release it (with the user’s consent) to other websites via a browser. Membersites: Websites that request user data from Homesites via a browser. The Sxip Network Rootsite: The central identity registry that manages Homesite and Membersite membership in the Sxip Network and issues and stores the data that identifies users as members of the Sxip Network (for example, a user’s Globally Unique Persona Identifiers (GUPIs) are stored at the Sxip Rootsite). Link . More detail Link . This is a decentralized, secure solution that can scale. If websites adopt it, the network effect will kick in massively and this will better the internet. In their own words, “The Sxip Network is a simple, secure, and open digital identity network. By joining, Internet users are able to create, share and protect the privacy of their online personal information. Websites and portals can establish deeper relationships with their users and comply with privacy legislation, while facilitating single sign-on and easy data release for their users. Sxip believes the Network has the potential to be a key platform for Identity 2.0 infrastructure and weâ€™re working with the community on continuously improving the technology.”  Link This can help the internet in non-obvious ways, like killing comment and trackback spam. Sxip demoed at Supernova an Alpha release of Sxore, their free new comment server that stops comment spam on blogs (Sxore uses Sxip Network technology).  It should be available soon and information is available at sxore.com/blog/ . You can try this out (as a user) on a demo site here .

Odeo is great and works really well. We just have a funny feeling that iTunes 4.9 is going to have a somewhat substantial impact on the podcasting portal market.  One thing to note, though, is that iTunes is only most of the online music market, not all of it. Odeo and others can help fill in the gaps. Company:  Odeo Previous Profile: June 13, 2005 Link What’s New? Lots of Odeo beta invites went out today, and TechCrunch received one.  We signed up. We did things. Everything worked, except the “create podcast”, which they told us up front wouldn’t work. In their own words, “Odeo consists of three major parts: A catalog of audio content, of all types, which is constantly being added to. The Odeo Syncr, which let’s you download anything in the catalog (and, optionally, put it on your MP3 player). And creation tools, including the Odeo Studio, which let you publish your own audio content, which will then show up in the catalog. (The creation tools aren’t already for public use yet, though.)” Key additional information: – 6.3 meg syncr download (allows easy syncing with mp3 players, auto adding, etc.) – very hokey welcome message from Biz Stone – nice tools for finding/searching for podcast “channels” and adding them to your subscription – “create podcast” features remain unlaunched. – syncer works great My wish list – auto delete option after listening to a show (from the mp3 player) Screen Shots: Relevant Links: See previous profile Import podcast Odeo blog Top 40 channels Tags: odeo , podcasting , web2.0 , techcrunch , podcast",,2005-06-22 00:00:00

It expands ITunes functionality to view and add podcasts directly into iTunes. This is NOT the iTunes support for podcasts announced by Steve Jobs a few weeks ago that will be included in the next version (4.9) of iTunes (and will allow for creation and charging as well). BadFruit is independent from Apple. At this point, BadApple supports adding and listening to podcasts, but not creation and charging. It is a PC only product, no plug-in for Macs is yet available. There is very little information on the BadApple website. Some info from the SF Chronicle though – “At this point, there is no official indication of BadFruit’s origin. But a handful of signs seem to link the site to MP3Tunes.com, the online song store opened a few months ago by MP3.com founder Michael Robertson. Log files created by the software indicate that it talks to a server hosted by MP3Tunes. Code inside the software package, once downloaded, also show links to MP3Tunes. The privacy policies displayed by MP3Tunes.com and BadFruit are also identical in almost every way, with details such as the name of the company and the name of the service changed. BadFruit’s terms of use say that any legal actions concerning the software should be taken in San Diego County, where Robertson’s companies are based.”  Link Here is the whois information for Badfruit.com In their own words, “Podcast support for iTunes is here! Download the free BadApple plug-in which expands the functionality and interoperability of iTunes software. (iTunes is music software which works with iPod MP3 players.) BadApple adds interoperability to view and download podcasts directly within iTunes software. There’s no need to download and learn other software programs because everything happens right in the iTunes software. After downloading and installing BadApple, you will have a “Podcasts” link you can click on from iTunes. You can use this to browse through categories to find the Podcast you want. Each podcast has a description. Once you locate a podcast you are interested in, double clicking on the podcast will load it to your library. When you plug in your iPod the podcast will be loaded to that depending on your settings. BadApple is free software. There is no charge to download the software or use the software.” NOTE: Comments on their own discussion forum indicate serious integration issues with iTunes. We’ll update this as things progress.

The Chrysler Building 132 East 43rd Street, Suite 1000 New York, New York 10017 What is it? The Weblogs, Inc. network of weblogs (WIN) is a blog network – literally an affiliation of weblogs that are each focused on a particular industry or topic. For instance, my favorite weblogs, inc. blogs are The Web 2.0 Weblog , engadget , tvsquad , therssweblog and cinematical . There is a list to all weblogs, inc. blogs at the home page . In their own words: “Our Philosophy In Three Parts â€” Why we are doing this? Traditional journalism is, in a word, broken. Weâ€™ve spent the last decade working in publishing (online and offline) and we believe that traditional journalism is imploding. News outlets like the New York Times are experiencing huge embarrassments like Jayson Blair. We believe these episodes are based on the increasing pressure media companies have to watch their bottom lines, as well as the fact that these outlets do not allow user feedback. If The New York Times was formatted like a Weblog, then the subjects in Jayson Blairâ€™s stories would have been able to note the errors on The New York Timesâ€™ own Web site! Something that simple â€” empowering your readers to comment â€” could have prevented serious damage to the reputation of a respected news source. On top of the unnecessarily one-way journalism being practiced today, the media space is suffering from the appearance of (and in some cases outright) impropriety. Do you really trust CNBC to report on their parent company GE? How did you feel when CNBC had the then CEO of GE, Jack Welch, on air all day? How do you feel when reading Time magazineâ€™s coverage of AOL? Do you really trust ABC News to report on Disney? Even if these media outlets are doing a good job, and many of them certainly are, it is difficult to believe that you are getting unbiased news when journalists are working for the companies on which they are reporting. We believe participatory journalism is a better model than one-way journalism. Of course, participatory journalism is harder, more work and still developing as a discipline. We sincerely hope to help this field mature. Talent wants to be free. One of the after effects of the dot com boom and bust is that many of the most talented journalists want to work for themselves. After the bust everyone realized that a) no company is loyal to them and b) that they can often make a better living on their own and have a better lifestyle. Letâ€™s face it, working from home and having time to spend with your family, go on vacation, visit the gym in the middle of the day, and to pursue your interests is invaluable. As a journalist you get little to no security working at a big company. So if you can make the same living (or better) working independently with a better lifestyle, then why wouldnâ€™t you do that? Partnering is better than owning. Our goal is to partner with individual bloggers, letting them do what they do best (writing, creating community, researching) and support them with what we do best (upgrading the software that drives their Web site, generating revenue, running the business). We split the profits 50/50 with each of our bloggers taking out only hard costs (i.e., sales commissions, credit card fees). We also allow bloggers to leave our network at any time, for any reason, and take their content with them. The concept behind our agreement is that if you partner with us on a Weblog and leave a year later, you can take all your content with you and do whatever you want with it. Our only condition is that we keep our copy of the content that is already in our archive. We think this is the fairest arrangement possible and that it promotes the kind of partnership we want to have with our bloggers.”  Link Weblogs, Inc. is an add supported network (banner and adsense), with adsense revenues recently reported at $2,000 daily by Jason Calcanis , the co-founder. Weblogs, Inc. is the largest blog network, with over 80 blogs and 1,000 weekly posts covering 75 industries. Nick Denton ‘s Gawker is the second largest blog network ( wonkette , a Gawker blog, is one of my favorites). They also have a “best of” site/feed here .

This hasn’t launched yet, but there is some buzz around the blogosphere (and the Wall Street Journal )  that Google is planning on launching a competing payment service to PayPal . Is this Web 2.0? I think so. If its p2p, which I imagine it would be, then it certainly is. From the WSJ article: “For Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., a payment service could represent a significant expansion beyond online advertising, which generated 99 percent of its $3.2 billion in revenue last year, the Journal said. Online-payment providers typically take a commission on each transaction.” Google has a hill to climb – paypal has 72 million users (PayPal accounted for $233.1 million, or 23 percent, of eBayâ€™s revenue during the first quarter). However, they’ve done this before with search (v. everyone), advertising (v. overture) and email, although not with a social network (see orkut – when’s the last time you logged in?) Gary Price noted that the company “ Google Payment Corporation ” was created by Google a couple of months ago: “I did a bit of research (love that deep web (-:) after reading the article and discovered that two months ago Google filed the paperwork with the California Secretary of State and formed the Google Payment Corporation. Interesting.” Gary also noted that someone registered “ googlewallet.com “. More on this as it develops.

The new site is great, adds lots of new features and we look forward to future improvements. It’s hard to say that I like it more or less than the “old” technorati – things grow on you and it takes time for new stuff to settle. But so far, I like it and the new feature set is strong.

,Profile: Furl,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/19/profile-furl/,"Company:  Furl Status: Founded in the spring of 2003 by Mike Giles. Acquired by Looksmart on September 23, 2004 Origin of the Name: “The origin of the name came from the very geeky description of what the system does – File URLs. If you can enter a URL and see it in your browser, we can save it for you. Once the name started being used and it was time to find a replacement, we just couldn’t come up with one we liked more. It’s short, simple and pretty easy to remember. And as an added bonus, the definition of “furl” is “to roll up and secure,” which is exactly what we do with all the interesting Web pages you find online.” Link What is it? Furl is a social bookmarking site often compared to Deli.cio.us (TechCrunch review of delicious here ). However, there are some key differences and many people use both obsessively. At its core, once you’ve signed up with furl, if you find a site/post that you want to retain, you can “furl” it and it is saved for you. You can find the site/post later by searching for tags that you’ve associated with it (or other meta data), or by a text search. If you understand delicious but are unfamiliar with Furl, the best way to describe Furl is a more structured delicious. There are much deeper meta data options when bookmarking a page, for instance. With delicious, currently, you can only tag a page and annotate it with notes. With Furl, you can tag it, categorize it with pre-populated items, rate it and add notes. Many Furl users like these options when tagging pages. Some users don’t need the extra data, and don’t like the time it takes to fill it out. To see this visually, here is a screen shot of a furl bookmark: Furl also does other things differently than delicious. The site you’ve bookmarked is saved at Furl (each member gets 5 gigs of storage), which means you can keep data even if the page changes. And, this allows for super-fast text searches on pages you’ve bookmarked, something delicious can’t offer. John Battelle puts it this way: “So what is it about Furl that made me write that past paragraph? After all, it’s just a web page-saving application. Right? Well, yes and no. Furl does a good job of helping you manage your web browsing. It adds several features that others don’ t have – full text search on your saved pages, for example. But Furl saves the entire web page you’ve “furled”, not just the URL, which prevents link rot, on the one hand, and creates what I’ll call a “PersonalWeb,” on the other.” <a href=""http://battellemedia.com/archives/000591.php""  Link Viewing all of your furl links is much like delicious. You can either view them by signing into the site, or you (and everyone else) can view the links by going to the user-specific URL. For instance, all sites bookmarked with Furl by techcrunch can be viewed at f url.net/members/techcrunch .  These pages are available by RSS as well. Replace “techcrunch” with any other user name in the link above, and you can see their bookmarks, too. Furl also has a private option, however, and those links will not be viewable to anyone except you. There are also other nice Furl options, like adding friends who can be notified of your new postings, and the Furl search engine is fantastic, almost as an afterthought. Another feature – if you view a furl’d URL, you can see other URLs that user’s Furl’d as well – a great way to find related content (see last screen shot below) Overall, Furl is excellent and highly recommended. Key Features: – easy bookmarking of sites – retains cached copy of site – tag and full text search – easy sharing of bookmarks – great tools ( Link ) – great search engine – great recommendation engine based on your furls – see last screen shot below) – passionate users (see relevant links below) Additional Screen Shots : Relevant Links: About Faq Contentious on Furl Furl Tutorial Roxomatic Contentious – 10 cool things to do with furl Battelle on furl Passingnotes on furl Scip on furl P.S. on not using Furl D-Lib Magazine on Social Bookmarking Sites Technorati tag: furl delicious tag: furl Furl Search: Furl ThinkLemon Tags: furl , bookmarking , web2.0 , techcrunch , socialbookmarking , looksmart roxomatic – Social bookmarks review Marshall’s Web Tool Blog (discussion of Furl “tagging”)",,2005-06-19 00:00:00
,Profile: Postsecret,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/18/profile-postsecret/,"Editors Note: PostSecret is not a for-profit company as far as I can tell. But it is beautiful and interesting and I feel like profiling it here because, as we say in our About section, we are profiling companies “that are making an impact (commercial and/or cultural) on the web 2.0 space”. Clearly, PostSecret is making a cultural impact on the web. Website:  PostSecret Location: Germantown, Md. Launched: January 1, 2005 What is it? Postsecret is a weblog that asks people to submit 4-by-6-inch postcards that contain anonymous secrets. The postcards are scanned and placed on the website. PostSecret has thousands of daily visitors and a quick check of RSS reed subscriptions shows thousand of people get RSS feeds daily with new postcards. In their own words, “Each secret can be a regret, hope, funny experience, unseen kindness, fantasy, belief, fear, betrayal, erotic desire, feeling, confession, or childhood humiliation. Reveal anything – as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before.” It is a beautiful site and a wonderful idea. A few Comments left on PostSecret: “When I read these, I don’t feel so alone.” -Calgary “I wish I could give all these people on the site a hug and tell them it’s ok to be human.” -Washington DC “Your site is truly inspirational, I’m left feeling full of compassion for my fellow human beings – We’re the same the world over.” -England. “I cryed when i saw your site. Its truly amazing that so many people have so many secrets like mine. I wish i could just tell most of these people it will be ok, cause i myself have never had anyone tell ME that…and it would help.” -West Virgina “So many of my secrets are there, without even sending a card.” -Mexico Screen Shots: Relevant Links: NY Times on Postsecret Technorati Tag: Postsecret Delicious tag: postsecret Flickr tag: postsecret BoingBoing on Postsecret Internet Archive SophisticatedSecrets on PostSecret Travels with Rhody on postsecret Tom Keating on postsecret",,2005-06-18 00:00:00
,Profile: Blogads,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/18/profile-blogads/,"Company:  BlogAds What is it? BlogAds is an Ad network for big blogs, and only big blogs. From their site, you generally need at least 1,000 daily readers. From their FAQs: “What is the minimum daily user number a blog should have before they can consider blogads? Blogs without a laser-sharp focus on one topic or community AND an audience of 1000 readers a day usually do not attract advertisers. But some blogs with a sharp focus AND an audience of thousands a day do NOT get advertisers either. One test: have more than a handful of companies expressed an interest in advertising on your blog?” The ads are “skyscraper” format and can include images, text and a link. See the screen shots below for examples. Publishers choose the blog(s) that they would like to advertise on, based on price, length and subject matter. Prices are not CPM or CPC based – rather the ad runs for a length of time in exchange for payment. Ads may run for 1 week, or 1-3 months. Prices currently range from $10 â€“ $4500 per week. Most of the top blogs use blogAds: “All blogs in the top 30 have an income stream. Only one blog had no advertising or affiliate programs (it did have a donation button though).  The most popular Income Stream on these Blogs is BlogAds – 23 of the top 30 have them.”  Link (from April 28, 2005) And they seem to be making a reasonable amount of money: “The average blogger makes $30 $50 a month selling Blogads, with some pulling up to more than $5000 monthly. As advertiser appreciation rises, your yield should rise. Blogads receives 30% of your ad fee, unlike other networks that charge far more or won’t even tell what they take.”  Link In fact, some blogs make the majority of their revenue from Blogads: Link Overall, it is a great and popular advertising network for bloggers with very large audiences (this is not a long tail play, at least yet). Since CPM and CPC rates are not an issue, all a blog needs is a big and relevant audience to attract advertisers, and the money rolls in.

,Profile: Digg,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/18/profile-digg/,"UPDATE: More recent profile of Digg here . Company:  Digg What is it? Digg is very early stage, sort of pre-beta. But its getting some buzz. Think of it as slashdot but potentially better. We first came accross it at TheShiftedLibrarian and after checking out the service ourselves we were quite impressed. In their own words, “Digg is a technology news website that gives editorial control back to the community. Most technology websites allow users to suggest content by submitting links or stories to an editor.  If the editor believes the story to be relevant to the masses, he or she moves the story to the homepage. With digg, users also submit links for review.  But rather than allowing an editor to decide which links go on the homepage, the users do.” Stories are first submitted by a user, along with a category. Other registered users will see the story and can “digg” it by clicking on a link. The more it is “digged”, the more popular it is and good things start to happen with the story. Once it has 15 diggs, it’s automatically moved up to the home page. As an example, we submitted our vskype profile from a few days ago. A search of “vskype” on digg shows the story along with others here .   Users can choose to digg the story, blog on it, add comments, report it as spam, etc. Friends (and everyone else) can see what storied you digg by looking at the URL for your username. For instance, the stories that Techcrunch has “digged” are at digg.com/users/techcrunch . Stats for the user are also shown (and we are now determined to make ours outstanding) :-) “User profiles are one of the most powerful features of digg.  Once logged in, digg bookmarks each story for which you have clicked ‘digg this story’. Users and friends can then browse your profile (digg.com/users/username), to see what you’ve been digging throughout the day.  Have several friends using digg? Use your favorite RSS reader or Firefox’s live bookmarks to keep track of them all. RSS feeds are available on almost all pages and user profiles throughout the site.” There is also good, functional search: Everything is available via RSS, which is a necessary feature of course. Awesome! The current release is scheduled to be updated on June 26 , including a new design and new features. Currently, the site is running slow but they are dealing with the scaling issue.  Overall this is a very cool site and we are now behind it 100%. Hopefully the new release will have delicious-like toolbar options for easy post submitting. We’ll definitely be coming back for a look on June 26 for the new 2.0 Beta !

Podscope makes audio files searchable by text keywords. It works pretty well. Search results show lists of podcasts that include the keyword, with links to the podcast. Also, you can also listen to a short 10 second snippet of the portion of the cast that includes the term you’ve searched on. This requires Macromedia Flash. This is great for research and ego searches. For instance if you here is a link to search results for podcasts that include the term “Dave Winer”. Click on the + sign next to a result and you can listen to the snippet: In their own words, “What is Podscope? Podscope is the first search engine that actually allows you to search for spoken words within any audio or video file. Weâ€™re starting with podcasts and will be adding all types of multimedia in coming months. How does it work? Just like any other search engine. You enter a word or phrase in the input box, and weâ€™ll show you a list of results. By clicking on the (+) sign next to each result, you can select snippets of audio to help you decide whether to listen to the whole podcast or even subscribe. If you know about Search Inside the Bookâ„¢, thatâ€™s what we do for audio/video. No, I mean how does the technology work? Well, we could tell you, but then weâ€™d have toâ€¦ Um, magic.” The company is either affiliated with or uses technology by tyeyes .

Rojo’s most recent round of funding was lead by BV Capital and TPG Ventures.” What is it? Rojo is a web-based RSS Reader (list of all here ) that combines great “standard” RSS feader features with tagging and social networking. It is an interesting experiment that is getting a lot of buzz. The service is completely free for users. It includes adds in the user interface. In their own words, “Rojo means “RSS with mojo” and in this spirit our company is dedicated to providing the best RSS feed reader around so that busy people can manage and read content as efficiently as possible. Our vision is that the next generation of feed reading requires new forms of organization so we built in the ability to tag your world, your content, your feeds, and even your friends. We believe that analytics and community based features are what make feed reading accessible and appealing to technophiles and new consumers alike so we provide RojoBuzz, which tracks which webpages are most linked-to by the feeds you read. With Rojo’s community features you can share stories, feeds, tags, contacts, and profile information with your friends and colleagues, making it easy to find, discover, and share interesting content. This is what we are dedicated to providing. This is what we are passionate about. “ Signup was easy (with standard email confirmation), and I was able to import all of my feeds from bloglines (although this process could easily be simplified – I would much rather just tell them “bloglines” and my username, which some other web-based RSS readers do. Export of feeds via OPML is also offered. Rojo’s magic – what makes it stand out from the crowd – is the ability to tag posts, feeds and contacts. You can use those tags to sort and find your content, but you can also use them to find other potentially useful content from others, including your contacts. Adding contacts and sharing tags and feeds is very simple. Taggin of posts and feeds also partially solves the ranking problem with blogs – it helps the cream rise to the top. There are some other excellent reviews of Rojo out there and we’ve linked to many at the bottom of this post. See, for example, Jeff Clavier’s analysis here .

What is it? Deli.cio.us is also one of the defining web 2.0 applications. It was created by Joshua Schachter . Delicious made tagging popular. It is an open-bookmarking service with tagging. You tag your bookmarks (any URI, meaning a web page or a single blog post), which helps you organize the data. The exceptionally cool thing about delicious is that you can view the data that others have tagged in many different ways. There are tools you can add to your browser, etc. to easily tag URIs as you view them. The second screen shot below shows this in action For instance. deli.cio.us/marrington shows all the delicious tags I’ve ever created. Likewise, del.icio.us/joshua shows all of the tags created by Josh Schachter, the founder. You can also view the data by tags. del.icio.us/techcrunch shows all techcrunch tags added by users. Replace “techcrunch” in the URL with anything else and see the results. You can also view popular tags at del.icio.us/popular . And so on. RSS feeds are available for any search/browse string, so monitoring new tags is a snap. Every day, people find new ways to use delicious. In their own words, “del.icio.us is a social bookmarks manager. It allows you to easily add sites you like to your personal collection of links, to categorize those sites with keywords, and to share your collection not only between your own browsers and machines, but also with others. Once you’ve registered for the service, you add a simple bookmarklet to your browser (see below). When you find a web page you’d like to add to your list, you simply select the del.icio.us bookmarklet, and you’ll be prompted for a information about the page. You can add descriptive terms to group similar links together, modify the title of the page, and add extended notes for yourself or for others. You can access your list of links from any web browser. By default, your links are shown to you in reverse chronological order, with those you’ve added most recently at the top. In addition to viewing by date, you can also view all links in a specific category (you define your own categories as you add the links), or search your links for keywords. What makes del.icio.us a social system is its ability to let you see the links that others have collected, as well as showing you who else has bookmarked a specific site. You can also view the links collected by others, and subscribe to the links of people whose lists you find interesting.” I often refer to delicious to find pages that I’ve bookmarked.

Link What is it? “The word Trumba is actually an old Sardinian word for the kind of horn the town crier would blow when announcing the day’s news to villagers.” Trumba is an online calendar. Think Outlook but where multiple people/groups can author and view the calendar. Share it with some people, or publish it to the web. Yes, it’s Outlook on steroids. Trumba brings together Visio co-founders Jeremy Jaech and Ted Johnson with Visio CTO Peter Mullen. The user interface is well thought out, easy sailing. Having Kleiner and August behind you helps you hire the best of the best, so I’m not surprised at its ease of use. The signup process was one page, with a standard email confirmation required. Adding a new calendar item was a snap, and the level of detail you choose to include is up to you. Overall, it is a pleasure to use. You can also create multiple calendars (think work, friends, family), and have different colors for each to keep track of them. The product is not free, however. A sixty day free trial is included. After that, the price is  $39.95/year. In their own words, “Trumba OneCalendar is a new type of calendar service â€” a connected calendar. Trumba OneCalendar brings all of your schedules together â€” work, family, community and fun â€” into one easy-to-use calendar that keeps you connected to the people and groups you care about through events you share.” One thing to note about open source competition: Dan Gillmor says  “My current hopes are on the Chandler project at the Open Source Applications Foundation. (Disclosure: The project’s funder, Mitch Kapor, is also one of my seed investors.) Chandler still isn’t ready for prime time, either, but there are definite signs that it will be a huge help for people like me.” Key Features: – web based, no downloads – Create unlimited calendars – Publish group calendars as web pages – Share a calendar privately – Email upcoming events to a distribution list – Synchronize with Microsoft Office Outlook – Access your calendar from any Internet-connected computer – works with nternet Explorer 5.5 or later, Mozilla 1.4 or later, NetscapeÂ® 7.1 or later, Firefox 1.0 or later, and Safari 1.2 or later Screen Shots: Management: Jeremy Jaech, President and CEO Ted Johnson, Vice President Products Peter Mullen, Chief Software Architect Dennis Tevlin, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development Clyde McQueen, Director of Software Engineering and Web Operations, Link Relevant Links: What’s New at Trumba FAQ Press Jeff Nolan on Trumba PlanetTroy on Trumba SiliconBeat on Trumba Boyosphers on Group Calendars Mike Lanberg on Trumba Martin Tobias Trounces Trumba – “Trumba says they will have a calendar sync thingy for Outlook, but it is not ready – I say why launch without it?” Tags: trumba , calendar , outlook , techcrunch , web2.0",,2005-06-16 00:00:00
,Profile – Vskype,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/15/profile-vskype/,"Company:  vSkype Location: Santa Cruz, California Launch Date: June 15, 2005 What is it? vSkype is a new product launch by Santa Cruz Networks (disclaimer: Keith Teare , a partner at Archimedes Ventures, was formerly the CEO of Santa Cruz Networks). vSkype is an add-on to Skype that lets you have up to 200 people on a video call . We tested the software out this morning and it works very, very well. Voice and video quality was more than acceptable. A bunch of video add-ons for Skype have emerged over the last few weeks, including jyve and spontania . We have not tested these services yes and so cannot compare them with vSkype. In their own words, “How is vSkype Beta different from other Skype video plug-ins? vSkype Beta provides fast real-time video between you and all of your Skype contacts – up to 2.3 frames per second (fps) for anyone using a standard 56K modem, and up to 24 fps for anyone using DSL, a cable modem, or a corporate broadband connection like a T1 line. vSkype Beta also allows you to share display data.  Any open application, or even the entire desktop, can be viewed by other participants during a vSkype Beta call. In addition, vSkype Beta’s “Add to Call” feature allows you invite other Skype contacts to your existing call. This eliminates the disruption of having to create a new call each time you would like to add new callers. With vSkype Beta it is possible for up to 200 people to participate in a single call or meeting without degrading overall performance. All those people can broadcast video at the same time, if they choose, and each participant can view any 8 people at a given time.” “vSkype Beta allows users to securely conduct video calls in groups from 2 to 200 and share applications, spreadsheets, presentations, or photos with others on a call. In future releases users will be able to download and play Santa Cruz Networkâ€™s games with other Skype users and access our library of camera personalities, wallpaper, and drawing tools. Professional users will be provided with various call controls, white boarding, meeting moderation, bandwidth control, and recording and archiving tools through our network of partners.” Om Malik has a great comment on vSkype: “This cannot be good for NetMeeting or Web-Ex, which will have tough time competing with a much lower cost offerings. I think this product has a good chance of becoming a major enterprise play.” Given that both of these companies share Draper Fisher Jurvetson as an investor, I would not be surprised if an acquisition is coming. vSkype Features: – up to 200 simultaneous users (!) – great video and audio quality – share any application (powerpoint, websites, etc. with the group) (last screen shot shows Keith sharing the TechCrunch website with me) – ability to turn off video but leave audio on, for those “bad hair days” – easy invites to all or some of your skype contacts to get them using it. – if you don’t have a video cam, you can still participate with audio and see everyone else’s video Screen Shots: Management/Directors: Barry Spencer  – Founder, Chairman, & CTO Timothy C.

,Profile – Talkr,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/15/profile-talkr/,"Company:  Talkr Location: New Hampshire Launch Date: April 18, 2005 What is it? Talkr is a site/service that converts text feeds directly into audio files. For instance, to listen to this post, click here . As a blogger, signing up is relatively simply. Steps: 1. Make a request at the site here 2. They quickly send a follow up email, with a link to a user agreement that you must physically sign and fax or send back to them. The agreement allows them to place ads into the audio, so that is another potential revenue source for them (and I’m fine with that since they aren’t charging me for the service) 3. Once you return the documents, they send another email with directions on setting it up at your blog. This consists of adding an html snippet (note the talkr gif under our xml gifs at the top of our sidebar. You also have a URL structure to allow any post to be listened to – See above for the audio of this post. The audio can be downloaded as an MP3 file as well. As a listener, there is fairly deep content to scroll through, and you can add any other blog you like (up to three for free). Given that they have only been live for a month, the content is actually quite good (heck, it includes Techcrunch :-) ). There is both search and browse capability, and there are links to a few on the home page to allow easy testing of the service. The recording is automated, but good quality. The main problem is that you lose hyperlinks and images. In their own words, “Talkr provides a service that allows you to listen to your favorite text-only news sources rather than read them. If you can point us to an RSS feed (a machine-readable version of your favorite blog or news source) we will convert that feed from text to speech. Talkr can also provide you with a podcast of your favorite news sources. This means that you can plug your MP3 player into your home computer once a day and Talkr will provide you with hours of audio content with no additional work on your part. Talkr will keep tabs on your feeds and send audio to your computer as those audio files become available. Does this cost money? Well, yes and no (mostly no). Talkr has partnered with several of the most widely read blogs on the internet to provide an audio version of those blogs for free. In addition, if you sign up for a free membership, you can listen to up to three additional blogs for free.  If you want to listen to more than 3 feeds (plus all the free ones), we ask that you sign up for one of our monthly subscriptions: Talkr Basic or Talkr Premium.” For listeners, there is a free version, Talkr Basic for $5/month and Talkr Premium for $8/month I like this service and there may be some “there” there, as Keith always says.

,Snocap Profile,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/14/snocap-launches-digital-music-registry/,"Company:  Snocap Location:  San Francisco, California Status:  Launched June 13, 2005 Founded: September, 2002 What is it? Snocap allows those who own rights to music to place them onto p2p networks and retail sites with DRM . This means that, through Snocap, music can theoretically be controlled (charged for and copies restricted) and still leverage the extremely popular p2p sites for distribution. It was founded by Shawn Fanning , the creator of the original Napster p2p filesharing network in 1999. The current business models for selling music include iTunes (pay per download) and subscription services like Yahoo, Napster and Rhapsody that allow you to listen to, and download, anything and everything in their catalog for a monthly subscription fee ranging from $5 – $20 per month currently. Snocap does things differently. They are decentralized and therefore do not require, or even provide, a centralized service for downloading music. Rather, they have focused on the platform and relationships with labels. Current label partners include: Universal Music Group, SONY BMG MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT, EMI, Absolutely Kosher Records, Artemis Records/Sheridan Square Entertainment, Digital Musicworks International, IDEA Distributors, I AM Music and Entertainment, Gammon Records, Independent Online Distribution Alliance, Kufala, Streetbeat Records / Pandisc / Kriztal Entertainment, Nacional Records, Nettwerk Records, OM Records/Deep Concentration, One Little Indian, Psychobaby Reality Entertainment, Ryko Group, Six Degrees, SSDD and TVT Records. Snocap allows labels to charge for music (snocap will take a cut ranging from 0% – 2.5% of the fee charged by the labels). They also charge labels for premium accounts give increased functionality and reporting. Services to Labels: – allowslabels and individual artists to embrace peer-to-peer networks as a safe and secure distribution channel. – one-stop access to clear rights and manage online distribution across retail destinations. – ability to maintain full control of content by determining business rules and setting pricing and usage terms. – accounting and reporting services – method for independent artists to distribute and sell their music Services to P2P and Retail sites: – centralized access point for all their licensing needs. – ability to sell music from the vast selection of music now only available on file-sharing networks. – incremental revenues from live, remixed and out-of-print works – reduced costs by eliminating the need to maintain relationships with thousands of copyright holders Screen Shots: Management: Shawn Fanning – Chief Strategy Officer Ali Aydar, Chief – Operating Officer Christian Castle – General Counsel Investors: Ron Conway Morgenthaler Ventures WaldenVC Relevant Links: Press Media Coverage BusinessModelInnovation del.icio.us Tags TechStartups",,2005-06-14 00:00:00
,Feedburner Profile,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/14/feedburner-profile/,"Company:  FeedBurner Location: Chicago What is it? FeedBurner is a service that takes a normal, everyday RSS or Atom feed of any kind and turns (burns)  it into a FeedBurner feed that you can then distribute to readers for use in any RSS reader. The company currently hosts more than 60,000 combined RSS and Atom feeds for over 40,000 content publishers. The company’s hosted service currently processes over 5 million daily views of RSS content including podcasts and video weblogs. One reason a blog or website owner would want to use this is because it simplifies the RSS feed. The Feed URL for Techcrunch, for instance, is “http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch”, which is a much simpler format that standard RSS feeds. Also, most blogging software offers a variety of RSS feeds – Atom, RSS 1.0, 2.0, etc. Sometimes these feeds don’t work properly with some readers. And if a site can get most of its readers to use the single Feedburner feed, they can take advantage of the great statistics and tools to see where readers are coming from and what they are clicking on. FeedBurner offers two services – a free version and a Pro version that costs between $5-$16 per month depending on the number of feeds managed. The stats for the free version are great, and the pro version also shows more detail and a “who’s syndicating me” feature. The Pro version has a 15 day free trial. The big reason for using FeedBurner, however, is that it can automatically add Google Adsense adds to your feeds, allowing you to easily generate revenue if you have a large enough audience. There are a number of influential bloggers who don’t like this service, however (and other aspects of FeedBurner as well) – see Relevant Links below for more information. One drawback to FeedBurner was the difficulty in turning it off and moving your feeds off the network (while retaining your audience). The method for doing this was complicated and clunky (or required you run your site from your own server) and so many top bloggers stayed away from their service. However, on June 10, 2005 FeedBurner announced (this is the FeedBurner blog)  a new feature to allow easy transition away from FeedBurner whilst retaining your readers. Nice move. So FeedBurner offers ease of use, great stats, revenue AND a relatively painless way out. Thumbs up from TechCrunch and that’s why we use them . Key Features: – very easy to use – nice URL string for the feed – generate revenue from RSS ads – RSS page isn’t just xml code, it has a nice look/feel – great stats for your feeds – easy transition out of FeedBurner if you ever want to leave Screen Shots: Management: Dick Costolo, CEO Eric Lunt, CTO Steve Olechowski, COO Matt Shobe, Chief Design Officer Link Relevant Links: Feedburner blog Fred Wilson on FeedBurner Dave Winer Posts on FeedBurne r WorkBench on FeedBurner Nick Bradbury Alex Bosworth on FeedBurner larixconsulting.com blog.bulknews.net Feedburner Blog on support for iTunes and Odeo extended RSS support",FeedBurner,2005-06-14 00:00:00
,Profile – Pubsub,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/14/profile-pubsub/,"Company:  PubSub Location: New York Launched: February 9, 2004 What is it? PubSub, which is short for “publish and subscribe”, is a future search engine. It’s also called “persistent search”. Users input keywords on subjects that they are interested in. The keywords are stored, or “persistent”.  PubSub’s matching engine compares these stored/persistent queries against newly-discovered pages on an ongoing basis, in real time. What this means: If you would like to be notified of websites that post about subjects you are interested in, you input the search terms, and PubSub will notifiy you as posts appear that include your keywords. A great (necessary, really) feature is the ability to store any persistent search and view it via RSS in your favorite reader. At TechCrunch, for instance, we have stored search terms like “Web 2.0” and are notified in our RSS reader of all new posts or articles that include the term “Web 2.0”. People generally refer to what PubSub does as either persistent search or future search, whereas regular search engines like Google are refered to as retrospective search. Persistent search notifies you of future content as it is created. Retrospective search engines help you find content that is already out there on the web. If you find it hard to get your mind around this, try it out, and make sure you take the RSS feed from your subscription so that you don’t have to go back to the site to check and see if there are any new results. As the alerts start rolling in to your RSS reader, you will be very pleasantly surprised. PubSub is also very strongly behind a structured blogging initiative which helps bloggers structure topic-specific posts like reviews (books, music, etc.) and events. A wordpress plugin is available at structuredblogging.org , that we use here at TechCrunch as well as on our personal blogs. We like pubsub and have many, many subscriptions to keep us up to date on topics that interest us. As an example, here is the RSS feed for our subscription to “web2.0 and web 2.0” (where we seem to consistently find great posts from a blog called the Read/Write Web , the second best Web 2.0 blog on the net :-). Key Features: – Future or Persistent search at lightning-fast speeds (subject only to RSS time limitations) – web based – IE or Firefox client option – see screen shot #3 – Great user interfact Screen Shots: Management: Bob Wyman, CTO and co-founder Salim Ismail, CEO and co-founder Richard Treadway, CMO Link Relevant Links: press media coverage about pubsub Bob Wyman’s Blog John Battelle on PubSub Charlene Li on Pubsub",,2005-06-14 00:00:00

Gataga is a social bookmarking search engine. As of today, it indexes bookmarks from del.icio.us , blogmarks , blinklist , jots , spurl , furl , simpy and connotea . They added furl, simpy, spurl and connotea literally overnight at the request of Alexandra Samuel at You’re It! . Alexandra also suggested RSS feeds for search results, and they have added those today as well. There is a “Sherpa” option that acts like the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button at Google. It needs some work to become useful – although typing in “techcrunch” and hitting the Sherpa button brough us right to where we wanted to go. Searches can be made by keywords or tags (both shown below). The fact that they are including most tagging data sources as well as the search result RSS feeds make this a compelling and useful site if you are interested in searching through socially-tagged URIs.

It is way neater than that. YubNub is a “command line for the web” and was built with Ruby on Rails . What this means is that you can access web applications (like google, amazon, and everything else) via the command box on YubNub’s website. A command consists of at least two pieces of information – an application identifier and a specific command. For instance, if you type in “flkall ireland”, YubNub will redirect you to the flickr website and show pictures with the tag “ireland”. There are a ton of commands available and functionality to create new ones directly by users. You can also use YubHub as a Firefox extension and other ways . Favorite Commands: flkall – shows flickr phots with all tags entered GMT – find local time and date in entered location mini – turn a long URL into a short one using minilink.org pod – search for podcasts on Podcast Alley. quote – get a stock quote, just enter the symbol say – to “say” everything entered after “say” Example An alias for “tts” areacode – Lookup a city by area code.

,Odeo Profile,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/13/odeo-podcast-central/,"Company:  Odeo Location : San Francisco Status: Private Beta What is it? Odeo will be a a podcast service that lets users search, find, and subscribe to podcasts, as well as a tool to create your own podcasts with minimal hardware. Odeo is built on Rails . In their own words, “Hi. We’re Odeo (pronounced like rodeo). Somewhere in an apartment in San Francisco, we’re making it easy for you to discover, create, and subscribe to fresh, independent audio content for your iPod (or whatever MP3-player-type-deal you prefer).” There isn’t much to see yet because their product is only available via an invitation-only beta. However, there are a couple of people who’ve tested the product and have blogged on it. From webreakstuff : “They make it easy to subscribe to audio content of your preference by browsing categories, and check what everybody else is listening to. Additionally, they allow someone to add any show thatâ€™s not in the system yet, and if youâ€™re actually the publisher of a current channel, Odeo makes it easy for you to take control and customize it. Unfortunately the Odeo Studio feature isn’t up yet. Odeo Studio is, and I quote, a browser-based tool that makes it easy to record and publish. With the Studio, and a cheap microphone (or even the one built into your laptop), you have everything you need. Thats interesting, and if they do things right, that may be the feature that gives them the edge I was talking about on my previous post about Odeo and iTunes. We’ll have to wait and see. I like how the overview page (the entry page to Odeo) lists featured content, the Zeitgeist (what people are listening to right now) and Odeo news.” It looks like Odeo will also support tagging of content, which will be a crucial way to find good stuff – audio, unlike text, is hard to preview and so metadata is even more necessary.

,Backpack Profile,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/12/backpack-showcases-rails-ajax/,"Company:  BackPack What is it? BackPack launched in early May 2005, and it is one of the defining web 2.0 applications. BackPack does one thing very, very well – organize your personal information online. It has a basic package that is free, and it is one of the first applications built on AJAX and Ruby on Rails . If you aren’t familiar with these development platforms, all you need to know is that data transfers and page updates occur without submitting and refreshing, it is lightning fast and there are NO client downloads to deal with. BackPack is a perfect use of these emerging development technologies. To understand how this technology kicks web 1.0 in the pants, just compare it to Microsoft’s One Note (which I used for about 10 minutes before never opening again). At its core BackPack is an information management tool. It is one of the showcase applications created by 37 Signals , along with Basecamp (“Project Management Utopia”) and Ta-Da Lists (“Make Lists and Get Stuff Done”). In their own words, “â€œWe call it useful” Some have called Backpack “a wiki with out the wacky.” Others have called it “blogish.” Others have said it’s a project management tool for all the little things in your life. Some say it’s a application that helps you get things done. Some have called it Basecamp’s little brother. Call it what you will. We call it useful and hope you do too. Last but most: Clear, Simple, and Fast. At the heart of Backpack is simplicity and clarity. Things work the way you’d expect them to work. Everything complex has been tossed so the tool is simple to the core. In fact, nothing takes more than a few seconds. Our “Ajaxed” interface elements eliminate reloading hassles. Backpack gives you the benefit of the web (centralized access, no install, no IT nightmares) without the downsides of the web (reloads, slowdowns, poor interfaces). Information management on the web has finally been realized. Backpack it.ï¿½? There are a number of suggested uses, with screenshots here . In our opinion, the key uses are to create pages of to do lists, planning for trips or events, taking and updating notes on products, etc. The great thing about it is how easy it is to create a new page, and add text and files, including images. You can share those pages with friends or the whole world. After you create pages, you can group them in any way you think is appropriate. There are no mandatory fields, complex multi-step processes, or specialized “buckets” for data. Pricing: A basic account is free. Upgraded accounts have a monthly fee of $5, $9, or $19 (see the last screen shot below) (more $ = more storage and more reminders). You need at least the $5/month option to get some file storage space. Features: – Home page to easily manage all sub-pages – Easy to make new pages – Easy to add content to a page â€“ links, notes, files, images, etc. – Set reminder feature, with reminders via email, sms or RSS – Tagging of pages – Sharing of pages (public or just friends) – email pages – email data to a page (like posting a picture to flickr with a cameraphone) Screen Shots: Relevant Links: BackPack Blog Reviews of BackPack (on a BackPack page!)

,Google Reviews Profile,https://techcrunch.com/2005/06/12/google-reviews/,"Company: Google (Reviews) What is it? There’s not much on the web about this yet, but Google is apparently looking at the reviews space and has put a very light experiment up on their site. I say “light” because the only product reviews they have up as of today are for Star Wars III. It looks like the first post on Google Reviews was by Photo Matt in a post dated May 9, 2005. Marc Canter spoke up today on the subject here . Reviews are a very interesting space. People use their blogs often to review books, movies, music, restaurants, and just about everything else out there that we interact with. It’s an obvious area to aggregate and network. Bob Wyman (see also structuredblogging ) (the CTO of PubSub ), has created a structured blogging plugin for WordPress for reviews (and also events) that is excellent and that I use at my personal blog . And there is also the hReviews initiative. Finally, there is a rudimentary blog review aggregator at blogcritics.org . Anyway, it is what it is and the space is worth watching.

Technorati is Web 2.0 “old school”: one of the original (and best) real-time search engines. It requested customer feedback and has used it to launch an extensive redesign of their site as a public beta. The original site is still up at www.technorati.com and the beta, for now, is at beta.technorati.com . Technorati claims to be indexing 800,000 + new posts daily, which is in line with competitor estimates of the size of the blogosphere. Technorati helped to increase the popularity of leveraging blog site metadata by allowing tag (or category) searches in their engine. By searching via tags, users can find content specifically tagged by the publisher (for now) under certain categories. The Technorati 100 is the definitive list of popular bloggers on the web. The new UI has several key upgrades: – Simplified Interface – RSS feeds for tag searches – Tag searches return indexed results plus flickr, furl, delicious, and buzznet – More homepage personalization â€“ including watchlists, claimed blogs and profile information – New Watchlist functionality Screen Shots:   Management : David L.

Both of these features are much needed tools to help users find tagged URIs. These tools will greatly assist users in researching related tags and to find good, related content to stuff they are interested in. Josh released a recommendation tool a few days ago: If you are on a particular del.icio.us user page (del.icio.us/username/tag), there is a link to see “recommended” tags that other people have used.

Brian Del Vecchio (good screen shots), Library Clips and Saurier Duval also write about this. Josh released search a few hours ago: This has been a badly needed service and others have tried to fill the void while Josh built it.

I’ve tested it out and it works very well. I’m not sure if the new search feature allows searching of multiple tags – an attempt gave me an internal server error.

Successful because we’ve met and profiled some great new companies (see no. 1 below), and have had a  number  of great  links to our site. Thank you to everyone who visits our site or reads our feed. Here’s this week’s summary. For additional web 2.0 information, thinking and reporting, I highly recommend Richard MacManus’ Web 2.0 Weekly Wrapup. Check out this week’s wrapup here . Indeed (raises money), YouTube , MSN Filter , Podshow (raises money), Browster (firefox version released), Pluck (new product releases), Qumana (new feature), Pheedo , FeedCatch , Consumating Dave Sifry and Technorati further updated their March State of the Blogosphere data (see last week’s web 2.0 summary for Parts 1-3) with information about Spam and Fake Blogs and The A-List and the Long Tail . “[T]he most influential media sites on the web are still well-funded mainstream media sites, like The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN. However, a lot of bloggers are achieving a significant amount of attention and influence. Blogs like bOingbOing, Daily Kos, and Instapundit are highly influential, especially among technology and political thought leaders, and sites like Gizmodo and Engadget are seeing as much influence as mainstream media sites like the LA Times.” For other news/gossip on Technorati, see our post Technorati (being acquired?) . Also, see Susan Mernit, saying “ Update: Latest word– this is an untrue rumor, not reliable .” Comscore published a blog report on August 8 with some seriously contentious data. It was announced by Fred Wilson on August 9, and everyone’s been buzzing about it this week. Comments include “Clearly the data is way off” (see the comments to Fred’s post ), “ I donâ€™t know what Comscore was thinking when they printed this data ” (Jason Calcanis), “ Jason Calacanis is having proper conniptions over the comScore marketing study on blogs released this week ” (Jeff Jarvis – this is my personal favorite quote), “ I know it galls Jason Calacanis that his sites are about as memorable as Burger King franchises, and that none register among the top blogs, except Pete Rojas’s Engadget ” (Nick Denton) and “ Chill out guys ” (Fred Wilson in a follow up post). You gotta love the two way web. From the Odeo Blog on August 10, 2005: See Om Malik ‘s and Jeff Nolan ‘s (“BitTorrent: VC’s Wanted – If podcasting is getting millions, BitTorrent deserves more”) thoughts on this (and bittorent) as well. Here’s Om: In an interview by Debbie Weil, Steve Rubel says he gets up at 4:30 or 5 AM every morning so that he can”pick the best stuff and get it up on the blog early so it can reach European readers”. I find it hard to get out of bed earlier than 9 in the morning (something Keith complains about constantly). I’m not lazy. It’s genetic. Seriously. If I tried to get up at 4:30 AM in order to get an early start to my blogging day, I’d be surprised if I could actually get my computer turned on. Steve, Europe is all yours. :-) From Kevin Burton . Seth is publishing a new book, The Big Moo by The Group of 33 , and he’s thought up a brilliant buzz strategy . He’s allowing a small group of people to pre-order 50 galley versions of his book for $2 each, if they promise to give away copies to sneezers (if you don’t know what a sneezer is, read one of his books – I’m a sneezer, and so are most other bloggers and blog readers). I’ve put in my order, and will give them out to people for free on my site. More on this as it develops. ZDNet Uk, a sister publication to CNET, issues an apology for the CNET article on Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt. In the article, they claim they spent 30 minutes on Google finding some very personal information on Mr. Schmidt. Google responded by blacklisting CNET for a year – “Google representatives have instituted a policy of not talking with CNET News.com reporters until July 2006 in response to privacy issues.” This all happened last week, but the ZDNet “apology” is a classic: As I said above, you gotta love the two way web. And British humor. From StellarBay . Will writes: Will, good post. It’s here, now, and I’m betting you are one of the ones who sees it.

,Profile – Feedcatch,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/13/profile-feedcatch/,"Thanks to Nivi who pointed me to FeedShake ‘s new FeedCatch  feed archiving service . FeedCatch is a nice little tool that allows you to take any feed and archive posts indefinetely (or less so if you set the parameters to do so). there are a number of default options, including: It takes just a few seconds to set up a feed and choose the parameters for archiving.  Headlines and some summary text are shown. Note that you can use the FeedShake service to create a merged/sorted/filtered feed from multiple feeds, and then archive everything using FeedCatch. Check it out. The service is free and requires no registration. The TechCrunch feed we created is here . There is a bug report that is being worked on.

,Profile – Consumating,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/13/profile-consumating/,"Consumating is dating 2.0. Yes, it’s dating with tags . They also use a bit of Ajax in their interface. After registering (it’s free), you create an online profile. The key difference between this and other dating sites is that you write tags for what you are looking for, and how you describe yourself. I registered (purely for research purposes, of course :-)), and used a number of fetching tags to describe myself, such as “web 2.0” and “RSS” (hey, I am who I am). My profile can be viewed here : Once you are a member there are a number of interesting features. You can add people to your hotlist, or just say “you’d do them” or “you wouldn’t do them”. They do tend to get to the point. They have a recommendation engine that takes your reviews and recommends other people you might like as well. Consumating also has a nice sense of humor to help offset the brutal effects of honest tagging and comments. For instance, they refer to everyone you might meet on their site as “prospective ex-partners”. Nice. You can also add tags for other people, and leave comments. Of course, you can send private messages to people as well. This uses up points, and I’m not entirely clear how to get them back. I’ve pinged the founders and will hopefully have more information soon. From their About information: Given our competitiveness, we hope you’ll sign up and give the thumbs up to Techcrunch. Email me if you do and I’ll send the first 5 a TechCrunch Tshirt or bumper sticker, your choice.

,Profile – Pheedo,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/12/profile-pheedo/,"Pheedo is a network that brings advertisers to blogs. I spoke with Bill Flitter , Pheedo’s Chief Marketing Officer, earlier this week to get a better understanding of the business. Bill joined Pheedo as part of their Series A financing . Advertisements are inserted into feeds and/or the blog itself. Today, ads are text-based, with graphical ads being rolled out in the near future. 11,000 blogs are currently part of the Pheedo network, some of which are very large. Pheedo classifies blogs as “premium” or as part of a category (basically a group of similar blogs). Traffic is one metric for determining if a blog is “premium” or not, but Bill emphasized that it is not the only factor. Many of their smallest publishers, serving a specific niche, get the best performance, he said. Advertisers can target specific blogs and/or categories (topic based). Bloggers have control over whether or not they allow a specific advertiser to place ads on in their feeds and/or on their blogs. For bloggers, getting set up through Pheedo is relatively simple. They will set up a new feed URL for you. Alternatively, if you have a current feed with subscribers, they have tools to assist you in redirecting the URL to flow through Pheedo. There are no minimum traffic requirements to work with them. Advertisements are generally priced on a cpc (cost per click) basis. Advertisers also have a choice of offering a sponsorship – which is a set price on a blog or category to have an advertisement shown for a specific period of time. Click through rates on feeds is fairly high – 5-15% on average according to Bill. See their case study here comparing feed click through rates to email marketing. Pheedo currently serves their own ads, and uses Kanoodle to back-fill unsold inventory. Pheedo gives 65% of advertising revenue to the blog publisher.

,Feed Aggregator Market Share,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/11/update-techcrunch-aggregator-share/,"TechCrunch is two months old today. To celebrate, I thought we’d reveal our RSS Aggregator market share breakdown. Our numbers are much different than those published by Pheedo and Feedburner . The main difference is Pluck has surged way, way ahead – are others seeing this trend as well? FeedBurner Statistics – Top 5 (July 2005) (removing 10 most popular feeds): Pheedo Statistics – Top 5 : Compare this to TechCrunch readership (about 1,000 feed readers over last 24 hours): TechCrunch’s Top 6: Pluck is clearly the no. 1 aggregator for TechCrunch readers.

A key new feature is that all of these products syncronize feeds (and will hopefully syncronized read/unread posts in the next version). Pluck also does an excellent job of explaining what RSS is, and how to subscribe to feeds for new RSS/Atom users. See, for instance, the Pluck tour here and “What is RSS” here .

,Update – Qumana (New Feature),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/11/update-qumana-new-feature/,"Qumana (TechCrunch Profile ) is a wysiwyg blog editor that works with virtually all blogging software. See our previous profile for more information, but you can drag and drop images, have the text look exactly like you want it to without html or formatting tags, and write and edit posts even when you are offline. In our opinion it is the best software out there to do this (note: others disagree ), and unlike most of their competitors, it’s free. Yesterday Qumana announced a new feature: the ability to change previously published posts. Note that this new feature works with both Qumana and non-Qumana posts, so you can start using their software now and revise old posts that you wrote using your existing blog software.

( profile ) and Gawker – meaning they have hired bloggers to blog about specific subject areas and let them go. They’ve already evolved the product (by adding the blogger’s name, something they were originally criticized for not having), and we assume further enhancements will come over time. From the launch post by Adam Sheppard , Filter’s lead project manager: The current topic channels, and the bloggers for each channel, are: Blog opinions so far have been pretty evenly divided , although a lot of the criticism has come from people not liking the original format that didn’t name the bloggers. It seems to us that some of the original criticism was too aggresive – Filter has responded quickly to feedback .

,Update – Indeed (Raised Money),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/08/update-indeed-raised-money/,"Indeed  raised $5 million from the New York Times, Union Square Ventres and Allen & Company.  This comes on the heals of Simply Hired’s $3m raise last week ( Profile ). Congratulations Indeed! The money aside, a strategic partnership with the NYT is absolutely tremendous. Having access to Union Square Ventures (Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham) and Allen & Co. is also worth more than the money they’ve raised. This really is very important news. My bet is the Simply Hired guys are not enjoying their day. NEW YORK, Aug. 8, 2005 â€“ The New York Times Company announced today an investment in  Indeed, Inc. (www.indeed.com), a search engine for jobs that enables job seekers to search millions of job listings from over a thousand Web sites.  The Times Company, Union Square Ventures and Allen & Company, LLC are together investing $5 million for a minority interest. â€œWe are pleased to join Union Square Ventures and Allen & Company in backing Indeed, an innovative new firm that provides compelling job search capabilities to Internet users,” said Martin Nisenholtz, senior vice president, digital operations.  â€œThe Times Company has strong help-wanted franchises in print and online, and we believe it is important to invest in new technologies and services in this advertising category.” Indeed is the most comprehensive search engine for jobs, adding over 110,000 new jobs per day â€“ more than any other job search engine.

Indeed indexes all new jobs from each source every day, making it the freshest and most accurate source of jobs on the Web. â€œOur relationship with The New York Times Company, Union Square Ventures and Allen & Company will help us extend our lead as the number one search engine for jobs,” said Paul Forster, CEO and co-founder of Indeed.  â€œWe look forward to working with our new partners in our goal of revolutionizing job search.” The New York Times Companyâ€™s highly successful Web sites â€“ which include NYTimes.com, About.com, Boston.com and 35 other Web sites â€“ are visited by more than 31 million users each month, and include the leading Internet sites owned by a news organization.  The Times Company is the 11th largest corporate online network.  NYTimes.com alone generated 472 million page views in June. About The New York Times Company The New York Times Company (NYSE: NYT), a leading media company with 2004 revenues of $3.3 billion, includes The New York Times, the International Herald Tribune, The Boston Globe, 16 other newspapers, eight network-affiliated television stations, two New York City radio stations and 35 Web sites, including NYTimes.com, Boston.com and About.com.

,Profile – Youtube,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/08/profile-youtube/,"YouTube is very much like flickr ( profile ), but for videos. You can upload videos in a number of different formats ( .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG ). Videos can be of any length, but must be less than 100 mb in total size. Editorial restrictions consist of no “nudity and your video must be appropriate for all audiences.” ( link ). For additional requirements, see their help page. The service is completely free to users (publishers and viewers). YouTube converts video to a flash format, and therefore upload and playback is extremely fast. In our tests, videos uploaded significantly faster than in other services. YouTube is also a sharing network. You can add friends who are also member of the network, and email any video to anyone. YouTube also provides easy to use copy/paste code for emailing and posting on a website. You can also tag your videos, which results in bunching in a very similar way as flickr. Overall, the service is excellent. The service has recently been launched but seems to have quite a few users who have posted lots of content. Our absolute favorite is Matt Dances around the World . It shows an ex-programmer who’s travelling the world and dancing at famous locations – it’s awesome and very popular on the site. Other favorites are this and this (that’s me in the red shirt. ok, not) (how do people do this?). I suspect YouTube will be quickly acquired and/or duplicated. We love it.

,Profile – Zopa,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/07/profile-zopa/,"Zopa , based in London, is a lending network. Zopa synidicates loans requested by “borrower” members out to “lender” members, based on criteria and parameters set by both parties. Zopa stands for “Zone of Possible Agreement”, which “is the overlap between one personâ€™s bottom line (the lowest theyâ€™re prepared to get for something) and another personâ€™s top line (the most theyâ€™re prepared to give for something). Itâ€™s the way people negotiate all sorts of stuff – buying a car, getting a mortgage – even a teenager negotiating with parents about staying out late. If thereâ€™s no Zopa, thereâ€™s no deal.” We’re not sure about the “no middle-man” argument since Zopa is, in effect, acting as a middle-man and taking a 1% cut, but the idea is brilliant nonetheless, and it certainly seems to make it easier for people to borrow small amounts of money at reasonable rates. In order to lend or borrow, Zopa does a background and credit check on you to ensure that you are appropriate for their market. They attempt to do this online and with as little hassle to you as possible. Once you are approved you can lend or borrow money within various limits. For instance, you may borrow from Â£1000 to Â£15000, in Â£500 increments. Lenders can loan a minimum of Â£500 and a maximum of Â£25,000. If you’d like to lend more than Â£25,000, you must obtain a license to become a “consumer lending business”. Zopa will help you through this process. Zopa spreads the lending risk among many borrows to reduce overall loss risk. Contracts are set at Â£10 each and must be spread among at least 50 different borrowers. And Zopa aggresively pursues bad debts: Zopa claims 16,000 registered members. Currently, Zopa is only open to U.K. residents who are more than 18 years old and have a bank account and personal Equifax credit rating. Additional information is available at their Help site.

,Web 2.0 This Week (July 31 – Aug. 6),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/07/web-20-this-week-july-31-aug-6/,"A lot happened in our web 2.0 world this last week. Lots of new data was published by Dave Sifry and Technorati,  additional work was done on the definition of â€œweb 2.0″, as well as lots of other developments (see below for all). I was forced to cut some things from the wrapup this week because otherwise it would have simply been too long otherwise. For instance, I had the following items in my notes, but they have been scrapped: Before I get into the main items, I want to point to a new blog I read (I do not know the blogger but I have pointed to it once or twice)  that had a post last week entitled â€œ Itâ€™s lonely starting a blog “. The post is self explanatory. Since even the Giants of our industry every once in a while reach out to their readers to make sure they are still there, I ask those of you who are so inclined to reach out and leave a comment on this blog. This isn’t pity, or charity. It’s simply helping one blogger get over that initial hurdle. I also want to thank Jeff Jarvis . Ok, back to business. This week’s wrapup: GmailDrive , BlinkList , IceRocket (name change), TalkDigger , XMHD , Jyve , Browster , MSN Start.com , Collaborative Rank , Indeed , Simply Hired , IceRocket (Link Tracker), Chalk , Yorz , AttentionTrust , Blinksale Technorati updated their  March  data last week with new stats, and the blogosphere’s growth certainly doesn’t seem to have peaked yet. We (as in “we the blogosphere”) are averaging about 1,000,000 new posts per day, even on slow news days. Six months ago it was less than 200,000/day. And the total number of blogs continues to double approximately every five months. This information is simply staggering, even as we are becoming somewhat deaf to new staggering information. CNET names the “ Top 10 dot-com flops “. I knew and loved most of these companies, and remember those lovely days when just about any idea could get funded. Yes, we all burned through money on stupid things like television ads (too bad Purple Cow hadn’t been written yet or we’d know better) and million dollar parties, but at least it was a learning experience, right? :-) And dammit, we LOVED Webvan. We really, really loved them. Doc Searls and Martin at Mediatope added to Richard MacManus’ worthy efforts to define Web 2.0 earlier this year (with further thoughts by Richard as well). A separate thread, started by Tim Bray and countered by Tim O’Reilly , argues whether or not Web 2.0 is a meme or a faux-meme. I’m not smart enough to comment on this – I had to look up what meme meant on Google just to follow the conversation. :-) I will say this though. Those of us that spend all day, every day, thinking about Web 2.0 aren’t able to define it in a single sentence. We know its important, and it’s happening right now, but we just aren’t quite able to verbalize it. Yet. When Fred Wilson writes, thousands of people eagerly consume it. He’s smart and he doesn’t go on and on – he gets to his point. His post “ Posting, Subscribing, and Tagging ” is one of his best essays so far. Fred also stresses that we are just getting started, and that the best stuff is yet to come. We agree. Additional Links:  Matt McAlister , Hyku , Gaping Void , Charbuck.com The problem with publisher tagging is that it is begging for spam. And it’s starting to appear. See Om Malik and Michael Parekh on this topic. Library Stuff tipped us off to a new report by Wildbit on social networks . It’s worth the read – particuarly if you are going to start a new one. Wikimania was held in Frankfurt on August 4-8, 2005. Lots of bloggers attended and, you guessed it, blogged. I would very much have liked to attend. Additional Links:  Ross Mayfield #1 , Ross Mayfield #2 , Ross Mayfield #3 , Blogging Planet , PR Thoughts , Gabriela Avram , more Bill Machrone looks at blogging software, and gives appropriate kudos to Moveable Type . I don’t disagree with the article, but I will say this. Blogging software sucks. And there is huge room for improvement. When my dad can publish a professional looking and customizable blog without knowing a thing about html or CSS or RSS or Atom or categories or tags or anything else, then talk to me about how great blogging software is. Sorry folks, it’s not even close to time to start patting ourselves on the back yet. Somebody needs to do for blogging what Blinksale ( profile ) did for invoices. Then we’ll be somewhere.

,Profile – Yorz,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/06/profile-yorz/,"YorZ (pronounced “Y” “or” “Z”, but the founders aren’t uptight about it) is a job referral site that pays bounties to people who refer the person who becomes employed. It is very early stage but nevertheless has an interesting business model and a very smart team of founders and employees. I spoke with the two founders today, Brian Goler and Kevin Berk, and got a very good feel for their business. Additional features are promised soon. YorZ allows companies to post jobs (with or without a bounty), people to refer others for jobs, and people to apply directly for jobs. Their listings are available on their site, and they also syndicate listings out to Simply Hired , Indeed and other job posting aggregators. Employers pay a $10 fee per listing, althought that fee is waived if the employer chooses to pay a success-based bounty of $50 or more. The bounty, which is paid only if an employee is successfully sourced through YorZ and begins working, is paid directly to YorZ, which then distributes it out to the referrer or referrers of that candidate. The employer is asked to leave feedback (on a scale of 1-5) of referrers and candidates. YorZ syndicates their listings out to various free aggregators, and will also post the listings on paid sites such as Monster on behalf of the employer (passing on the fees). People who want to refer jobs to others have a couple of tools to use. They can send emails directly to the company and/or the person being referred or they can set up a “ Bounty Roll ” on their website. The Bounty Roll is a widget that you install on any web page that lists job postings according to filters you set, such as keyword, bounty size, location, etc. You can also choose the number of listings to be shows, from 1-10. YorZ creates an easy to use html snippet for you to use, based on your parameters. If there are any successful hires through your Bounty Roll links, you get paid the bounty (suggestion: add a search box to the Bounty Roll) Bounties are paid if a person you referred first takes a job and begins working. If your email is forwarded (creating a Referral Chain ), the last six referrers share the bounty equally. If you are paid bounties of $600 or more in a calendar year, YorZ will submit a form 1099 to the IRS. Applicants can apply directly for a job, of course. If there is no referrer, YorZ keeps the bounty for themselves. YorZ is a great idea and could get traction. The service is naturally viral (emails to people you refer as well as the Bounty Roll). We also like that they have RSS feeds and email alerts for all categories and search results.  Their competitors include KarmaOne , Mkt10 and HeadlessHunter .

,Profile – Blinksale,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/06/profile-blinksale/,"Want an easier way to manage invoices? Blinksale is for you. And even if invoices aren’t a problem for you, take a minute and check out their site. It is visually and functionally stunning . It oozes AJAX and Rails, and thoughtful, creative design. That’s not surprising, since a design company specializing in AJAX, Firewheel Design , created the site. But it is also wonderfully easy to use – the features are not just there to visually impress. I love it, and I never send invoices. Blinksale tackles a simple need in a straightforward way. Invoices are always a hassle for small businesses. You either need to hack up a Word or Excel document and forward it, or use expensive accounting software. Some people just send text invoices in email. It’s not very pretty, and unless you are using accounting software there are few or no tools to help you follow up and manage invoices after they are sent. Blinksale solves all of this. First, it takes moments to create and send a very professional invoice. I literally registered a new account, created a faux invoice and sent it to my partner at Archimedes Ventures, Keith Teare, in about 5 minutes (I billed him $25,000 for “services” – let’s see if the deadbeat pays). Blinksale currently supports 160 currencies. You can include your paypal information in the invoice and be paid by that method, if you can do business with paypal (in my opinion the world is divided firmly into two types of people: people who’ve used paypal for one year or less, and people who’ve been ripped off by paypal and subsequently have been ignored and/or berated by paypal “customer service”). By the way, after registration, blinksale creates a unique home page for you – ours is techcrunch.blinksale.com. After creating an invoice, there are a number of management tools at your disposal. First, Mac users can sync their invoices with iCal. For the rest of us, an xml feed is available and you can subscribe to invoices via RSS. Reminders and Thank You notes can be sent to clients. Paid invoices can be marked as paid and closed out. Blinksale has a number of account options , ranging from free to $29/month. The paid plans all have a 30 day free trial, and there is no minimum period (and no refunds for termination before the end of a month). The paid plans allow for customized templates (using CSS), more users, more invoices, more clients, etc. For futher reading, the Blinksale blog is here , and the  Firewheel Design blog is here .

,Profile – Simply Hired,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/05/profile-simply-hired/,"Yes, we have been  infatuated with jobs sites these last couple of days. Trust me, there’s more to come. This space is moving and we fully intend to jump on the train. Or in front of it. Hope to have a profiel of YorZ up later today as well. Simply Hired is a vertical search engine for jobs and can be compared to Indeed , its primary competitor. Yesterday, Simply Hired announced that it raised $3 million in new captial from Rajeev Motwani, Ron Conway, Kanwal Rekhi and Garage Technology Ventures. The company had previously raised $1.2 million from its founders. Guy Kawasaki also joined their board of directors. Much like Indeed, Simply Hired gathers job postings from a huge set of sites, including Monster, the Wall Street Journal, CareerBuilder, Hotjobs, craigslist and others. Simply Hired then structures the data in the postings and allows its users to search for specific keywords, titles, companies, locations, etc. Searches can be further refined, including by freshness of the posting and by lists like “fortune 500”. Once a user has the final search result set that they want, future job postings meeting the search criteria can be delivered to the user via RSS and/or email alerts. One interesting feature is the ability to rate a posting, with 1-5 stars. Their idea is to generate enough user rating content to be able to recommend job postings to you, based on how you’ve rated other postings (and how other users have rated those postings). See our profile on Loomia – they are doing something similar in the podcasting space. To round things out, Simply hired has promotional snippets for your website here , and a corporate blog here. (sans comments). I actually can’t say if I can pick between Indeed and Simply Hired. Both changed the jobs game permanently (as witnessed by Hotjobs changing their model to incorporate other listings). Both are excellent. Simply Fired is a sister site to Simply Hired that is centered around Mark Jen , the 22 year old who was fired from Google for being incredibly stupid. The idea with Simply Fired is that you write the story of how you were fired, and win prizes if it’s considered one of the best. I tried to find a good story to link to but they are all pretty obvious – sleeping with bosses daughter, ran over bosses foot, etc. Some of them may even be true. I have deep respect for this as a nice viral marketing tool (sort of), but FuckedCompany is a much better read. But back to Simply Hired, it is a beautiful site with meaningful results, and definitely a cool web 2.0 business.

Chalk is a Ruby on Rails and Ajax-powered web application to collaborative manage your daily life. Quoting the introduction: One thing they stress on the announcement is that they’re doing things the web 2.0 way, by adding a social network layer to the software and having an extra edge on interaction by using Ajax. We’ll be looking forward to checking Chalk out as soon as there’s more information on it. There are other applications set to do similar things so if life-management is your coup-du-jour you may want to have a look at Backpack and the upcoming Writeboard too.

,Profile – Collaborative Rank (Del.Icio.Us),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/04/profile-collaborative-rank-delicious/,"Collaborative Rank is an experiment created by The University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. It is a search engine front end for Del.icio.us bookmarks. The search engine is heavily influenced by what they describe as the “Top 500” del.icio.us taggers .  This doesn’t just look at who bookmarks the most pages, but who bookmarks things quickly, and in ways that other people subsequently copy (affirming that you are tagging in a way that others think is appropriate). In their own words, “Users on del.icio.us who give meaningful tags to helpful/timely URLs (as evidenced by others subsequently doing the same) will be rewarded with higher CollaborativeRank, which means that their tagging will have greater influence on this search engine’s rankings.” I’m proud to say that I made the list of 500 – #499 to be exact (oh great, another thing to compete over). :-) This is a great relevancy tool for searching del.icio.us content. Collaborative Rank has a discussion forum here .

,Profile – Indeed,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/04/profile-indeed/,"Indeed is not a newly launched site, but the job space seems to be heating up and so we are going to profile a number of web 2.0 jobs-related sites and services in the coming week. Upcoming profiles include simply hired , Yorz , Glendor Showcase and others. At its core, Indeed is a vertical search engine for jobs. It has a huge data set – Indeed gathers jobs from nearly every job website (including Monster.com,  CareerBuilder, Hotjobs, craigslist and others), makes the jobs searchable via title, company, keyword and/or location, and presents results to the user. Search results can be further narrowed via suggested keywords. Importantly, once you find the job results you are looking for, you can have future job postings that meet those search criteria delivered to you via email alerts or RSS. This “prospective search” functionality is a key web 2.0 feature. All services are free for users. The site includes advertisements to generate revenue, and also partners with other sites. Indeed has some other interesting features and tools as well. For instance, click on their Job Trends link and see a map of the United States showing total number of job postings visually. You can easily zoom into any specific area. This page also shows major metropolitan areas, ranked by total number of job postings per  1,000 people. Today (August 4, 2005), San Jose is #1, with 73 job postings per 1,000 people. Oklahoma City is last, with just 12 job postings per 1,000 people. Indeed also has a Webmaster Tools area, where you can get code to display a jobroll or Indeed search box on your blog. You can also access Indeed’s XML API to integrate Indeed’s job listings in a more customized way on your website. Indeed’s corporate blog is here .

We grew to over 500 daily RSS readers yesterday (about six weeks after our initial launch). People seem to like our content and until now have overlooked our fairly pathetic design skills. Well, today that changes! We hired all-star developer and web designer Frederico Oliveira to redesign TechCrunch from the ground up. All of the bells and whistles should be finished in a day or two, but the general look and feel is now complete. Love it? Hate it? Let us know. Fred will also be posting occasionally at TechCrunch.

,Profile – Best Page In The Universe,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/03/profile-best-page-in-the-universe/,"This website is very, very funny. I’m not allowed to make normal postings today because Fred is still working on the site and he’s demanded that (i) I start using Photoshop for images, and (ii) I write only “standards based postings”. :-) So in the meantime I though I’d profile “The Best Page in the Universe”, a very funny site. My favorite page is his one on blogging . It’s funny, and I have to admit being guilty of many of the things he points out. “Blogger: Term used to describe anyone with enough time or narcissism to document every tedious bit of minutia filling their uneventful lives. Possibly the most annoying thing about bloggers is the sense of self-importance they get after even the most modest of publicity. Sometimes it takes as little as a referral on a more popular blogger’s website to set the lesser blogger’s ego into orbit. Then God forbid a blogger gets mentioned on CNN. If you thought it was impossible for a certain blogger to get more pious than he was, wait until you see the shit storm of self-righteous save-the-world bullshit after a network plug. Suddenly the boring, mild-mannered blogger you once knew will turn into Mother Theresa, and will single handedly take it upon himself to end world hunger with his stupid links to band websites and other smug blogger dipshits.”",,2005-08-03 00:00:00

,Profile – Msn Start.Com,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/03/profile-msn-startcom/,"Start.com, an RSS aggregator and search service,  is one of Microsoft’s “ Sandbox ” projects ( Virtual Earth is another one).  It is an AJAX application. Start.com is comparable to Google’s IG or personalized home product . The primary features include a drag and drop interface, easy addition of RSS feeds (although auto-discovery doesn’t seem to work very well, it hung multiple times on me), and integration with MSN Search. Feeds and other content are listed in a drop down menu on the left, and content can be “pinned” anywhere on the page. The Start.com blog is here . The only thing I can’t figure out how to do is delete the “popular” feeds that are pre-populated from the drop down menu. Like Google’s RSS aggregator, this is a great service for RSS newbies or people who only read a limited number of feeds.

,Jyve,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/02/jyve/,"Jyve is a set of applications that enhance Skype. I eventually had to tear myself away from the site because I kept finding new tools and features, but the core functionality can be summarized into four categories: As far as I can tell, Jyve is only available for Windows at this time. To use Jyve’s advanced applications, you must be running Skype v.1.3 or later. There is a small (1.3 mb) download. Here is a breakdown of the applications and what they do: You can view these tools here , and a feature showcase here . There are a number of code snippets on this page that you can put on a website and allow website visitors to interact with you in different ways.  For instance, the button below shows whether or not I am online with Skype, and clicking on it calls me (I’m trusting you people not to abuse this button :-)). The tools include CallTO (calls), IMTO (sends an instant message), send voicemail, create conference call, etc. These features will be extremely useful on intranets, wiki’s, etc. There is an “all in one” feature that creates a Jyve/Skype Card for you and that contains all of the features. You can use this tool to share a browser screen with other Skype users. None of my contacts are online right now since it’s the middle of the damn night (even the Jyve guys that I’ve been chatting with, Andrew Hansen and Gabe Morris, are offline – wake up so that we can look at TechCrunch together via Jyve! :-)), so I’m making an assumption that it works. I like this stuff, and I hope that Jyve adds additional productivity tools over time – sharing any application would be perfect. Powerpoint is the obvious one. This is a set of options that will leave auto-responses via IM or voice if you are away, on a call, etc. This is useful. But on a sidenote, I’ve come to the conclusion that it is fine if you don’t respond immediately to an IM – many times people are just sending you some information to consider and don’t necessarily want or expect an immediate response. But I digress… This is the good stuff for me as a user. When a Skype call comes in, you can set it to ring your home phone, forward to a cell phone, or forward to another skype name. Call forwarding requires SkypeOut (a pre-paid thing with skype that allows you to call normal phone numbers). This is really really cool. The only problem is that you must be logged in to Skype for it to work, and the time I most need calls forwarded is when I’m offline. This is a Skype issue, not a Jyve issue, and I’m sure Jyve will change this if/when Skype adds the functionality. That’s it! Like I said, there is lots of other functionality on the site but this seems to be the main group of applications. For heave Skype users, Jyve is a wonderful product. And it is clear that they intend to evolve these products, and release new ones, in the future.

,Meetro,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/01/profile-meetro/,"Update 9/29/05: Wired published an excellent article on Meetro today. Meetro is an instant messaging service that works both as a stand alone client and also integrates with other IM services (AOL and ICQ for now, others to come later). Meetro determines where you are phyically located automatically (or you can override by telling it manually) and shows you other meetro users near you. It’s a cool way to see when your friends are nearby, and to meet random people who are physically close to you. Meetro currently only works on the Windows platform, with Mac and other clients coming in Q4. The download is small – 3.5 mb, and registration was very simple. Overall, the service works very well. I chatted with two of the founders (Wendell and Paul) and also asked a couple of random people near me what they thought of it – everyone was very enthusiastic and loved the service. This is an application that will stay on my desktop. It will become increasingly useful as they integrate additional IM platforms, as I run five on my desktop currently (MSN, Yahoo, AOL, Skype, Gizmo).

,Xmhd (Gmail Hard Drive),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/01/profile-xmhd-gmail-hard-drive/,"XMHD is a service that allows you to use a Google Gmail account as a virtual hard drive. If you don’t have a gmail account (which requires an invitation), don’t worry. They’ll invite you. XMHD is similar to Gmail Drive , which we profiled yesterday. However, whereas Gmail Drive is an actual virtual drive on your Windows machine (and only windows), XMHD runs everything on its website and is therefore platform independent. All you need is a web browser and a gmail account to use it. There is also no account registration or download. Simply give it your gmail credentials and it logs into the gmail account for you and shows you its own front end. In their own words, “How does XmailHardDrive.com work? XmailHardDrive.com directly connects with your Gmail account to then turn it into a portable virtual hard drive that you can access from anywhere in the world.  You simply enter your Gmail username and password, just like the other third party software, and then using the username and password combination it authenticates with the Gmail servers and connects you to your personal account.  Therefore allowing the user to be able to upload files to their Gmail account. Next when the user uploads a file, the file is uploaded as an e-mail attachment in their Gmail inbox, this file however is encrypted and compressed which enables the user to store more files since it is compressed.  The file is then saved as an .xmhd file which can be decompressed and re-downloaded through XmailHardDrive.com.  And now with the FlingIt feature the user can send the file they just uploaded to a friend that has a Gmail account.  Currently the max file upload size is 20mb however as we gain more sponsors we will remove the upload limit, and you’ll be able to upload much much larger files!”  Link You can easily add files from your hard drive (or other connected drive). You can upload up to 10 files at a time. Files are compressed and stored in a proprietary .xmhd format, but can be double clicked and opened in their original format from the site (and saved, edited, etc.). There is also a cool “fling it” feature that emails a file to any gmail contact stored in the gmail account. If the person doens’t have a gmail account, they will have to get one and use xmhd to open the file. All of this is a bit of a hassle for email recipients – and although XMHD says that their file format is necessary for compression purposes (and therefore you can store more data on your gmail account), it is also a nice viral touch to the service because recipients of your file must log in to XMHD to view them. You can always of course, simply email your files directly as well, so its not a big deal and it is a nice feature. We also like the upcoming RSS feed into your XMHD: “XmailHardDrive.com is now in the process of building an RSS feed for your XmailHardDrive, which will allow developers to build applications that interact with your XmailHardDrive. We are also working on a Gmail notifier program capable of so much more than what the Gmail Notifier from Google can do. Stay tuned to the website for when these products will be released.” Link Overall its a great service, completely free, and just a bit better than Gmail Drive due to its cross-platform nature and “fling it” service.

,Profile – Gmail Drive,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/31/profile-gmail-drive/,"Service:  Gmail Drive Launched: v. 1.0.6 was released on July 27, 2005 What is it? Gmail drive is a service that creates a virtual hard drive folder on your Windows system, accessible through “My Computer”, that allows you to store files in your Gmail email account. The current Gmail storage limitation is 2 gigs. In their own words, “GMail Drive is a Shell Namespace Extension that creates a virtual filesystem around your Google Gmail account, allowing you to use Gmail as a storage medium. GMail Drive creates a virtual filesystem on top of your Google Gmail account and enables you to save and retrieve files stored on your Gmail account directly from inside Windows Explorer. GMail Drive literally adds a new drive to your computer under the My Computer folder, where you can create new folders, copy and drag’n’drop files to. Ever since Google started to offer users a Gmail e-mail account, which includes storage space of 2000 megabytes, you have had plenty of storage space but not a lot to fill it up with. With GMail Drive you can easily copy files to your Gmail account and retrieve them again. When you create a new file using GMail Drive, it generates an e-mail and posts it to your account. The e-mail appears in your normal Inbox folder, and the file is attached as an e-mail attachment. GMail Drive periodically checks your mail account (using the Gmail search function) to see if new files have arrived and to rebuild the directory structures. But basically GMail Drive acts as any other hard-drive installed on your computer. You can copy files to and from the GMail Drive folder simply by using drag’n’drop like you’re used to with the normal Explorer folders.” Link The service works as promised. After a quick download and installation, it installs a virtual gmail hard drive on your system, accessible through “My Computer”.  You can then drag and drop files into the drive. I tested out dragging and dropping files, and it worked well (if understandably a little slow – a 1.5 mb file took about 20 seconds to fully copy over. Individual files cannot be bigger than 10 mb or have file names longer than 40 characters (gmail limitations). We’ll also be profiling xmail hard drive , a similar service that is web-based, and so platform independent.

,Profile – Blinklist,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/31/profile-blinklist/,"Update: I really like the way Microcontent Musings breaks down web services into core web 2.0 functions. While it can be a little harsh, it’s also a nice “to do” list for new companies. BlinkList is only a month old…my bet is that in another month or so they will do significantly better than 1/10. :-) Company: BlinkList (a MindValley company) Launched: June 2005.

BlinkList is a social bookmarking service built on ajax.  It is very buttoned up and has some excellent features. It also has an all-star team with deep experience, led by their PR star (see team below) :-). We’ve profiled a number of competing services lately – see Shadows , del.icio.us , Simpy , Furl , Yahoo My Web 2.0  and  others . Blinklist includes most of the features from those sites, and adds a couple of others. Key Features: – easy bookmarking, including a bookmarklet if you want to have one-click bookmarks – adding “stars” to tags and bookmarks to easily find them in the future – Blinklist will take any highlighted text on the screen and auto fill a description field with the text (this is the only service I know of that does this, and it’s incredibly useful) – bookmarks can be private or public. You can email bookmarks to friends at the time of making them, which is also a very useful feature. TechCrunch bookmarks are here . – permanent tag pages – see for example www.blinklist.com/tag/web2.0/ (a nested/filtered search function on general tag search would be an awesome addition – Shadows has a “narrow results” option that is very useful) – a tag cloud for each user, as well as the entire blinklist community – “related tags” for currently viewed tags – “auto-complete” suggestions when tagging a bookmark – RSS for all pages – easy signup see the demo here to see some of these features being used. Overall, BlinkList is a worthy addition to the ranks of social bookmarking services, and one of our favorites. It doesn’t have the user base of del.cio.us, or all of the functionality of Shadows or Simpy, but it does have unique features that none of the others have. It could very easily get traction. Suggested new features: – full page caching with keyword search – shadow-page type functionality (this is going to really help with search engine rankings for Pluck, and it’s cool). – nested/tag filtering at all levels – show number of people who’ve bookmared a given URI Additional Screen Shots: Team: Vishen M.

They are not going to change their name to BlogScour, but they are going to launch a site called BlogScour that will contain all of their blog search capabilities. I saw this at Blogherald a few minutes ago (I cannot locate the mentioned SEW article), and emailed Blake to confirm the facts.

,Web 2.0 This Week (July 24 – 30),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/30/web-20-this-week-july-24-30/,"It’s been a fun-filled Web 2.0 week, capped off with BlogHerCon today. Good stuff below. 1. BlogHer Conference on Saturday, July 30, 2005 The BlogHer Conference ’05 is today, at Techmart in Santa Clara. “This flagship event is open to all bloggersâ€”including men and beginnersâ€”interested in enhancing their online exposure, learning the latest best practices in blogging, networking with other bloggers, and specifically cultivating the female blogging community. BlogHer Conference ’05 will provide an open, inclusive forum to: 1. Discuss the role of women within the larger blog community 2. Examine the developing (and debatable) code of blogging ethics 3. Discover how blogging is shrinking the world and amplifying the voices of women worldwide” We fully support the goals of BlogHer and are very excited about the buzz the conference is creating.  Blogging conferences tend to have lots of blogging coverage, and there are some excellent posts coming out of today’s event. There’s literally a ton of important stuff to read and think about. And unlike BeautifulPeople (see no. 10 below), we as men are actually welcome at this event. :-) And all kidding aside, if you only read one link, read Julie Leung’s “ A woman’s place is in the HTML ” I had the opportunity to see Julie speak at Gnomedex last month and was captivated by her ability to tell a story that contains a meaningful message.

Pheedo reveals RSS Aggregator Usage Pheedo (soon to be profiled) released very interesting stats on RSS usage this week. Key stats and information: “Tuesday is the most active day in RSS; Saturday least active.” (hmm, maybe I should move these weekly wrapups to Tuesday…) “The â€œmorning scanners” view most content; late night readers click through more.” “Consistent with other RSS aggregator market share reports on the Internet, Pheedo is seeing Bloglines atop our feed reader statistics, followed by Firefox, Thunderbird, NewsGator and Sharpreader. In aggregate, these readers are used by almost 70 percent of people subscribing to Pheedo managed RSS content.” Additional Links:  Tris Hussey , BigPicture , BackboneMedia , Richard MacManus 3.

The word-of-mouth network v. official PR Everyone was talking about MSN’s Virtual Earth last week ( profile ) except Scoble, because he wasn’t allowed to talk about it until the official Microsoft announcement. Scoble vents his frustration in a post that talks about the “word of mouth” effect in the blogosphere. “Yeah, it is the second time in a week that I can’t talk about something when everyone else is talking about it (the earlier one was when the name “Windows Vista” leaked out and about 2,000 blogs had talked about it before I was able to admit that was the official name.” “So, why do we have embargoes? I think it’s one of those last things that survive from old-school PR. They are trying to give everyone in the media an equal shot at being out at the gate. I personally think we need to reevaluate our rules here. The word-of-mouth network is just getting too efficient to try to live by these rules anymore.” One does ask the question though, “why did MSN release the site if they didn’t want people chatting it up”, doesn’t one?

Chris Were writes about Recency Chris writes an excellent essay about recency and how RSS can change the future web. At the end, Chris writes “Will such a system ever exists? Probably not” . We hope he’s wrong. :-) “Recency is an emerging technology – something that is (relatively) new to the web. Its main driving force is RSS, which provides a very simple mechanism to tell the world when something is new or has changed. What started out as primarily a tool for bloggers to communicate new stories is fast evolving to encompass new areas; mainstream media, audio (podcasts), video etc. There are many reasons to believe this is just the beginning – especially given Microsoftâ€™s anouncement that RSS will also be applied to â€œlistsï¿½? in their new Operating System, bringing RSS to the mainstream. So whatâ€™s so special about recency? Currently anyone can search google for anything and it will bring up a list of relevant resultsâ€¦ but what about NOW? I want to find results in the last 24/12/2 hours. The web as we know it started out with static webpages (the 90â€™s homepage) and has grown into dynamic webpages – where conversation and comment are the norm (blogging). This produces ever changing content where the ordering of the discussion is the relevancy. Google and the other mainstream search engines currently cater for the old days of static webpages. While this works well now, the future of search and web navigation with relevancy will be much more useful than the web today. (Obviously Technorati are beginning to provide this recency search service to blogging, along with other players).” 6. It beats making shoes for Nike Business 2.0’s blog notes an article fro Electronic Gaming Monthly and writes “sweatshops are popping up in Asia where laborers are paid as little as 56 cents an hour to do mind-numbingly repetitive tasks in these games that help them acquire virtual gold and other assets, which their employers then sell to other game players. One worker’s “typical 12-hour sessions can earn his employers as much as $60,000 per month while he walks away with a measly $150.” Welcome to the information economy.” From FacesofMe : “Who in the hell is buying that shit?” 7.  Kevin Kelley: We are the Web Kevin Kelley writes an article that will be referenced for years to come: “The Netscape IPO wasn’t really about dot-commerce. At its heart was a new cultural force based on mass collaboration. Blogs, Wikipedia, open source, peer-to-peer – behold the power of the people.” Additional Links:  Emergence Marketing , TimbreofTempests , fruitlesslabour , GMSV (excellent and funny user comments), Shinythingsthatdistractus , agenturblog , business2.0 8. Fred Wilson: Comscore Measures Blogs Fred Wilson shares statistics on the major blog service providers. I hope he doesn’t mind that we grabbed this from his site: 9. Steve Gillmor writes about AttentionTrust Steve continues to carry the torch on the captivating idea of “ attention ” ( profile ). He writes: “I’ve been writing about RSS and attention for so long that I’m starting to repeat myself, a sure sign of the difficulty in avoiding wasting your time. So we jumped the gun and put up this site with the help of some brilliant folks who gathered a week ago and contributed their ideas and talents to rough out the basics. I asked, no, pinned Hank Barry down to take the role of Secretary; Hank had suggested the idea of a foundation in the first place. Seth and I fanned out to corral the rest of the initial board: Seth as Chairman, Nick Bradbury, Dick Costolo, and Clay Shirky. And I asked Mary Hodder to chair the Advisory Board and develop its goals and structure. Later today, Seth will join the Gillmor Gang to talk more about attention and our intentions. Already the quality of the conversation about attention has deepened, both in private email exchanges and in feedback from our admittedly premature and sketchy efforts. We’re asking for a leap of faith here, and I always check for my wallet when someone says “trust me.” But we’re choosing our wordsâ€“and our friendsâ€“carefully, and we’re not kidding.” Dave Winer : “Apparently Steve Gillmor is not kidding about attention.” 10. Om Malik: Beautiful People, Not Smart Doesnâ€™t Mean Smart Om reports about an important (read: ridiculous) new social networking site…for beautiful people only. Maybe they’ll let us in, just to do a quick profile. :-) Of course it only supports IE, so we can’t see the site. We’re a mac and firefox shop and unless there is a really good reason to fire up IE and the obligatory pop-ups, we don’t. This site doesn’t qualify as a “good reason”. Additonal Links:  ypulse , USA Today 11. Seth Levine: Occam’s Paradox If you haven’t read Seth’s postings on “Occam’s Paradox”, read them now. They are a play on the Occam’s Razor principle, which in its simplest form is “The simplest explanation is the best.” Seth originally wrote here , and updated here . “Iâ€™ve been thinking recently about complexity in business and in life and think thereâ€™s a corollary to Occamâ€™s Razor that perhaps should be called Occamâ€™s Paradox – the propensity of humans to make things more complicated than they need to be.  I donâ€™t pretend to know why this is, but I notice it all the time (both in my own life and with other people).  I guess itâ€™s just easy to start down the road of dependency mapping (i.e., making everything you do a part of a larger matrix that has many interdependencies). ” In the update, Seth writes “I fell a little short of really saying what I originally intended for the post, which was that I think that we have a tendency not only to make things more complicated than need be, but also to focus on too many things (and therefore the wrong ones).  As a result we try to assimilate too much data to make decisions (not recognizing the massive diminishing returns on this effort) and try to pay attention to too many things.” See also Will Price, here , where he talks about the paper by Anthony Bastardi and Eldar Shafir. I agree. When I need to “get things done”, I switch the internet connection off (really), close email, and try to really think . When I was a corporate lawyer, working on documents and agreements, I was able to master this. Now, I really have to try. And when I make decisions, I try (and sometimes am successful) to really get to the core issues, ignoring the extraneous stuff. Additional Links:  Jeff Nolan , Todd 12. MicroContent Musings: Web 2.0 Checklist We missed this last week. Great evolving checklist for defining web 2.0 services. ”    * Structured MicroContent – a service should be able to handle structured MicroContent. This can be the data stored at the service or processed by the service; * Data Outside – the data should be primarily outside. Thus main focus of a service should be processing MicroContent and not storing MicroContent. This also implies that the service should be able to get the outside data. This can either be by a feed (limited window) or an import function. This also implies that the user is in full control (datalibre compliant) of his data (edit, delete, etc.); * Licenses – for each MicroContent Item the user determines the usage license. One can differentiate here between private data, i.e. data that is only for the user and thus has a very restrictive license, group data, where for each Item is determined which other user might do something with it, and public data, for which the Creative Commons licenses are valid. (remark: I might throw this one out, as it is strongly related to Data Outside); * Feeds Galore – A service should have many feeds to which clients can subscribe. This feeds mix and match the processed MicroContent in any way imaginable. Feeds can be compound in nature and use many types of enclosures. These feeds allow for syndication of MicroContent; * Web API’s – a service should offer many Web API’s, which allow their functionality to be integrated in other services; * Desktop Integration – A service should not only live on the network, but also allow tight integration with the desktop. This can for instance be achieved with MicroContent clients. * Single Identity – A user should not have to copy with creating identities at all services he wants to use. It should be sufficient to have a single identity (but multiple personae) that can exported to service; * MicroWeb – the user should be able traverse MicroContent space on the field level. From a single field in a MicroContent Item, the user should be able to go to relevant other MicroContent Items. The user decides for himself what is relevant. Thus seeing a name “Arnaud Leene”, he should be able to go to the relevant FOAF-file, Weblog, tags, etc; * lowercase Structure – a service should support lowercase MicroContent structure. This implies that the structure is not set beforehand, but is determined by the user. There are no standard setting committees or services that set structure in stone; * Placeholder – this checkpoint is a placeholder for something that I have not yet thought of, or seen on the Web” (Mostly) unrelated to Web 2.0: This last one’s for you, dad. :-) It sure looks like a middle finger to me. (Via David Weinberger ) And this one isn’t debatable.

,Profile – Icerocket,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/29/profile-icerocket/,"Company: IceRocket (Soon to be renamed BlogScour ) Location: Dallas, Texas What is it? IceRocket is a blog search engine, and a damn good one, owned by Mark Cuban. In our opinion they aren’t quite ready to take on the king of blog search yet, but they are feature rich and doing some things very, very well. There are two ways that people are comparing blog search engines today: total links for a given keyword or tag, and total links shown for a given blog. On both tests, IceRocket seems to be doing well (but not always ). On the links into TechCrunch, IceRocket seems to be far and away the most up-to-date, this week (things change rapidly in the real-time-web). IceRocket has a ton of great search and other tools, including search by keywords , tags (see their tag cloud here ) and URLs . They also have a trends service (see pre-defined trend competitions here ), and hell, they even have email (when I was COO of GNR in London I sold one of our companies, NamePlanet, to NetIdentity , another Mark Cuban company which powers this). Finally, they also have a toolbar , which is awesome if you aren’t like me and still have enough browser real estate left to actually view web pages. Basically, IceRocket is awesome. One area where they really shine is in search results. A result includes tons of useful links. In addition to a link to the source, there are also links to tags for the result, the blog itself, tools to refine the search to include or exclude that blog, number of links to the blog (for relevance and ego), and they even link to the RSS feed for the blog. All search results pages have RSS feeds. Another fun tool is IceSpy , which shows a rolling list of incoming search terms (all linked). This reminds me of the flat screen in Google’s offices that shows incoming searches (although Google appears to filter out adult terms while IceRocket happily does not :-)  ). They are changing their blog search engine name to BlogScour sometime in the near future. We’ve also seen an increasing trend by bloggers to tag their posts with IceRocket tags in addition to Technorati Tags.

,Profile – Blogpulse,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/28/profile-blogpulse/,"Company:  BlogPulse Launched:  Version 2.0 launched March 28, 2005 Location: Cincinnati, OH What is it? BlogPulse is an exemplary real-time search engine, with additional features like trends, conversation tracker and blog profiles. It’s parent company is Intelliseek . In their own words, “BlogPulse is a window into the blogosphereâ€¦open it daily to discover the people, issues, blogs, posts, commentaries, tidbits and news that bloggers are discussing.”  Link The BlogPulse site offers four main services that we profile here: Search, Conversation Tracker, Trends and Profiles. Search: BlogPulse search allows search by keyword or URI ( but not tags/categories, something that absolutely must be added ). Advanced search features are here . Sample searches yielded excellent results compared to Technorati, Feedster and others, although this is a quickly evolving space. In general, the index looks very up to date and complete, and searches are very fast. Conversation Tracker: The Conversation Tracker service is really cool. As the blogosphere has evolved, “conversations” are taking place in a decentralized and distributed manner over literally millions of blogs and other websites (whereas in web 1.0 conversations were generally centralized on a site, such as a newsgroup). â€œBlogPulse Trend Search allows you to create graphs that visually track “buzz” over time for certain key words, phrases or links. Compare search terms/links in isolation, or use all three fields to compare search terms/links against others. Type your search terms in the boxes on the left. Type descriptive labels for each search into the boxes on the right. Then choose your time frame: 1, 2, 3 or 6 months.ï¿½? Blogpulse has collected the full text of blog posts and analyzes citations to create a visual conversation tracker on a keyword or URI. It’s rough, but extremely useful for tracking discussions. See the videos here and here for further explanation. A key value of Conversation Tracker is to track viral diffusion associated with an individual post. Trends: The Trends service gives a visual graph of postings associated with keywords or URIs. You can also compare multiple items on a single graph. They also have featured trends for high profile news and other discussions. Below are two trend graphs. The first is for the keyword “TechCrunch”, the second compares postings of Harry Potter to Willy Wonka. Profiles: The Profiles service has fairly deep information about specific blogs, including overview, posts, citations, trends, sources, neighborhood. Check it out. Blogpulse also has lots of other cool and interesting links, stats, etc. that we are not profiling here.

,Update – Simpy (New Features),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/28/update-simpy-new-features/,"Company:  Simpy Previous Profiles:  July 18, 2005 What’s New? Simpy is a social bookmarking service  that can be compared to Shadows , del.icio.us , Furl , Yahoo My Web 2.0  and  others . Simpy released new features today, including – full text search of bookmarked sites – a tag cloud of your bookmarks – remove, rename, split, and merge tags From Otis on the Simpy Blog : “The Release Log has the details, but in short, I am happy to announce that the new Simpy release is out! The most notable features concern searching and tagging. The full-text search is back! Not only can you full-text search your own bookmarks, but you can also full-text search any other Simpy user’s public bookmarks. In my opinion, this is big and useful. Browsing by tags is nice, but is also limiting. Full-text search can do more, and since Simpy supports fielded search, you can always emulate tag search with queries like tags:foo (more info is in the FAQ). You can see your Tag Cloud now (just use the “tags” link in the nav bar at the top of Simpy pages). A Tag Cloud is a more visual representation of your tags and their usage distribution. Along with the Tag Cloud come the 4 new Tag functions: remove, rename, split, and merge. These 4 functions will let you mess with your tags to your heart’s content. If they are not enough, I’m all ears.” Release Notes are here . These are useful additional features. I really like seeing data in a tag cloud format for some reason – I’d love it if the RSS aggregators showed new unread content in this format – it would make it much easier to quickly get to the content I want to read. I also have to say that I was blown away by the Shadows “Shadow Page” idea – simple yet very, very useful, and I would like to see simpy and others consider this idea.

,Profile – Commontimes,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/28/profile-commontimes/,"Company:  CommonTimes Launched: July 13, 2005 What is it? CommonTimes is a social bookmarking site for news. Stories are bookmarked by users from around the web, and tagged. The level of prominence is determined by the number of users who have tagged the news source. In their own words, “CommonTimes is a social bookmarking site for news readers. Or, in simpler terms, CommonTimes is a news site that publishes stories based on how frequently you choose to bookmark them. The more widely our readers collect certain stories, the more prominently they will appear on our Web site. If you imagine the mainstream media exists at one extreme of top-down content control where a small group of editors determine what appears in the News, CommonTimes is exactly the opposite â€“ a bottom up news site at which grassroots Web readers determine the top stories by bookmarking them as they browse. Comparatively, CommonTimes is to news what Del.icio.us and Yahooâ€™s MyWeb are to Internet bookmarks. Contrary to Google News, a closed, automated system limited to mainstream media stories, CommonTimes is an open community system that accepts content from any news site or blog â€“ and is entirely driven by our readers. For example, while Slashdot and Grist Magazine provide a tightly controlled top-down filter of technology and environmental news that only rarely makes the mainstream media, our sections provide a bottom-up view of stories our readers feel are important from any source which may well integrate stories from the latter. News it what our community decides is news.” Link There are web 2.0 elements: social bookmarking, publisher and user tagging, comments to bookmarked stories, and RSS feeds for everything. It’s an interesting experiment and we look forward to participating. There are also easy-to-use tools for bookmarking sites, including tips on how to bookmark directly from bloglines . For an in depth overview, see Brian Del Vecchio , who writes a fantastic blog (and who tipped us off to the service).

,Profile – Springdoo,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/27/profile-springdoo/,"Company: SpringDoo Launched: Today in the US (previsously New Zealand only) What is it? Springdoo is an easy to use service where you call a toll free phone number, record a message, and then can have the message sent via email to your contacts. The email contains a link to the springdoo site, where the message is automatically played – it is not sent as a file attachment. The service is not free, but you get 10 minutes free by signing up. The service charges a minimum of one minute, and in 20 second intervals after the first minute. The charge applies to the length of the message recorded, so if you send a one minute message to 20 people only one minute is charged. It is currently available in New Zealand, Australia, the UK and the US. Here’s How it works: You call the phone number (your caller id must be on), record a message, select emails to send it to (up to 20) and send. The recipients receive an email, click on the link and listen to the message. A sample message can be heard here . We’ve recorded a test message here .

,Profile – Loomia,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/27/profile-loomia/,"Company:  Loomia Launched: June, 2005 Location: San Francisco What is it? Loomia provides search, recommendations, and personalization for podcasts, videocasts, and other syndicated media. In a nutshell, their goal is to help you find content that you will enjoy based on how you rate content you’ve already absorbed. The idea is awesome, and their approach is perfect (centralized website, plus distributed services to content providers) . As with most successful web 2.0 companies, they are leveraging their users to create their core value. Users rate content. Loomia compares a user’s ratings and recommends other content that they should also enjoy. For instance, if I like Podtech (which I do),  and if other people who like Podtech also like Earningscast (an Archimedes Ventures company), Loomia will recommend that I also check out Earningscast. Netflix takes a similar approach to recommending movies. My experience as the CEO of Zip.ca (a movie renting company in Canada) with similar recommendation features proved to me how powerful these recommendations can be. It is a hugely powerful way of connecting like minded people to like minded content. Loomia isn’t planning on keeping all of this data to themselves. A core part of their business model will be working with other companies (think odeo as well as podtech) to allow those services to add ratings, recommendations and other features. If Loomia gets in the middle of this data stream, they could have a very bright future ahead of them. Loomia is just getting started and the site reflects this. However, they have an awesome team (see below) and the core feature set is there. I recommend you give it a try. Mark, Loomia’s CEO, has promised to let me know when new features are added, and we will update their profile here at TechCrunch.

Google has added RSS and bookmark functionality to its personalized home page. Bookmark functionality is very basic – it adds a link (with an optional title) to your Google home page. It will be more interesting if they add delicious or shadows-like functionality. The RSS functionality works very much like Yahoo’s home page RSS reader, with cool options like setting the number of posts shown (up to 9), and the ability to drag and drop the feeds anywhere on the screen. It’s great for RSS newbies or if you have only a few feeds that you review daily.

,Profile – Konfabulator/Yahoo Widgets,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/26/profile-konfabulatoryahoo-widgets/,"Company:  Konfabulator (now Yahoo Widgets ) Acquired: By Yahoo, announced July 25, 2005 What is it? Konfabulator was acquired by Yahoo yesterday. In their own words, “Konfabulator is a JavaScript runtime engine for Windows and Mac OS X that lets you run little files called Widgets that can do pretty much whatever you want them to. Widgets can be alarm clocks, calculators, can tell you your WiFi signal strength, will fetch the latest stock quotes for your preferred symbols, and even give your current local weather.”  Link Konfabulator was originally launched on February 10, 2003, for Mac only. A Windows version launched in November 2004. Konfabulator required a download and works on both the Mac and Windows platforms. The Mac download is 5.4 mb, and the Windows download is 10 mb. The service previously required a fee but is now free. Set up was quick and very easy after the download. Basically, it runs small applications on your desktop (there are thousands to choose from). I like the calculator, sticky notes and RSS reader the best (although I cannot figure out how to configure the RSS reader to stop showing USA Today, and gave up). There are also widgets for weather, batter power, and just about everything else you can think of. A few are automatically downloaded with the installation, but they are easily removed and others are easily added simply by downloading them (they install into the correct directory automatically). Widgets can easily be moved around the desktop, customized, and delted entirely. There are tools to allow anyone to easily create their own widgets as well. Konfabulator looks and feels very similar to Dashboard on OSX for the Mac, although some people claim creating widgets is easier on Konfabulator. Overall, it’s cool but it will be uninstalled by the end of the evening. I noticed serious system slowdown after installation.

,Profile – Msn Virtual Earth,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/25/profile-msn-virtual-earth/,"Update:  This is a great tool for directly comparing Google Maps and MSN Virtual Earth. You can see the results for a search on both services and really compare them. Via Nathan Torkington Service:  MSN Virtual Earth Launched: July 23, 2005 What is it? MSN Virtual Earth is an excellent mapping/satellite imagery application. Much like Google Earth ( profile ), it is fascinating to look at, and very useful as well. There is no download required (whereas Google Earth has a 10 meg download). In addition to excellent search features, you can autolocate via your IP address (although I am in San Francisco today and it says I am in Seattle based on IP) or via a small download, which works very well. There is also a scratch pad to keep notes (there needs to be a print function added to this though). Mandatory first searches, of course, were of my home in Manhatan Beach and my parents home in Anacortes. The picture quality in MSN Virtual Earth was better than Google Earth, and the picture quality of my parents home in Anacortes was decent, whereas Google had nothing to show for them. Overall, MSN wins in this very limited test: Jeremy Wright posted an excellent review of the service and comparison to Google maps: â€œFirst, MSNâ€™s Virtual Earth is 10 times easier to use than Google Maps. Between the little compass in VE that you can drag and itâ€™ll just scroll with you (instead of Google Mapsâ€™ â€œclick, drag, click, drag, click, drag”) and the ability to zoom much more easily in VE (you can scroll, you can hit the +/- keys on your keyboard OR you can double click), this is an app that is much more thought out.ï¿½? â€œAt the same time, Virtual Earth is much easier to use from an â€œexploringï¿½? point of view. Hop off a plane, hit â€œLocate Me”, look for rental cars, then look for hotels, then look for somewhere to eat and then look for somewhere to catch a show. Boom, your whole day is planned and in your Scratch Pad.ï¿½?

,Profile – Feedshake,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/24/profile-feedshake/,"Company: FeedShake Launched: July 21, 2005 (estimated) What is it? FeedShake is a website that creates a single RSS feed from multiple RSS feeds. You can also filter out posts that contain specified keywords, and/or filter in posts only if they contain specified keywords. The site is incredibly easy to use (it takes mere moments to create an aggregated feed) and no registration or email address is required. Similar services are listed by libary clips here . According to Library Clips, “Actually this tool is quite unique as it is the first to do both splicing and filteringâ€¦there are many blending tools, but ReFilter seems to be the only standalone filtering toolâ€¦here are other general filtering tools.” ( Link ) The feed is auto-named “FeedShake” but can of course be renamed in your reader to whatever you want. It would be nice to be able to auto-rename the feed when it’s created so that other users would have the title you selected. Other current limitations: “This service is beta. Currently it supports RSS 2.0 feeds” We’d be happy to pay for naming and stats on the feed. :-) We tested the service by burning a combined feed of TechCrunch and EarningsCast , another Archimedes blog. The feed is: http://www.feedshake.com/feed.php?code=wc5mjf0wz4 . The feed works great. Awesome service. We love it.

,Profile – Attentiontrust,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/23/profile-attentiontrust/,"Update: For an excellent writeup of Attention Trust, see Seth Goldstein’s essay here . Company:  AttentionTrust Launched: Today (I believe) What is it? Attention Trust is a project led by Steve Gillmor and others that is the next evolution of his Attention idea. It is a “A non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the basic rights of attention owners”. From a post by Steve Gillmor on March 28, 2005: “What does matter is a pool of attention metadata owned by the users. This open cloud of reputational presence and authority can be mined by each group of constituents. Users can barter their attention in return for access to full content, membership priviliges, and incentives for strategic content. Vendors can build on top of that cloud of data with their own special sauceâ€“the newbie crowd of MyYahoo, the pacesetter early adopters of Diller/Ask/Bloglines, the social attention farm of RoJo, and Google’s emerging Office service components orchestrated by the core GMail inforouter. And the media, which now includes publishers, analysts, researches, rating services, advertisers, sponsors, and underwriters, can use the data as a giant inference engine for leveraging the fat middle of the long tail.”  Link So what is AttentionTrust? It’s light on content for now, but it proposes a basic set of user rights to their attention data: The idea of attention is hugely debated and polarized. It’s useful and needed, but will it work in the real world? The debate will continue as Steve pushes this idea forward. We’ve joined AttentionTrust, and look forward to developments.

,Web 2.0 This Week (July 17 – 23),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/23/web-20-this-week-july-17-23/,"It’s been a helluva week. Myspace got bought for over half a billion dollars. Podcasting died (but not really), and an important development in beer tapping technology was announced. Oh yeah, we spent the week at Always On and learned a lot about social networking in the real world. :-) For a wrapup of AlwaysOn, see our profiles and links here . Marc Canter’s new thing, GoingOn , was announced at the conference and we will profile it separately sometime in the next couple of days. 1. iTunes sells its 500,000,000th song. “TJPile writes “Apple’s iTunes Music Store can now say half a billion served. One look at Apple’s front page says it all. Sunday, at 2:44PM EST, Amy Greer of Lafayette, Indiana bought Faith Hill’s Mississippi Girl to win.”” 2. MySpace sells to News Corp for $580 million From Bill Burnham : “You may have seen the news today that Intermix Media was sold to News Corp. for a cool $580M in cash.  Prior to 2004, Intermixâ€™s business consisted of running a collection of largely undistinguished consumer-oriented websites.  Intermix (then known as EUniverse) didnâ€™t do a particularly good job of running these sites and was basically a broken stock suffering from earnings restatements, a NASDAQ delisting and executive turnover.  However in 2003/2004, one of the websites, MySpace.com started to take-off thanks to the social networking craze. As I outlined earlier, unlike Friendster and its clones, MySpace took a unique approach to the Social Networking space and concentrated heavily on building a community first (centered around music and bands), and a social network second.  The strategy worked and by the beginning of 2005 MySpace was the clear #1 player in the social networking space.” See Also: Jeff Clavier , Chew Shop , Many2Many , Paul Kedrosky , Blog Herald , Hitchhiker’s guide to 650 , Marc Canter , Scoble 3. Podcasting died last week (not really though) Frank Barnako writes a controversial essay last week titled “ Podcasting’s ‘indies’ are losing ground ” in which he states “Podcasters, your 15 minutes of fame is up” : “As podcasts have become available to a mass market, the media giants are moving in. ABC, ESPN, the BBC, CNN and Air America account for 16 of the most popular shows. Public radio programs took another 16 slots. Only four of the top 20 were created by “amateurs.” Two were devoted to news about the Macintosh; a third was Chris Pirillo’s tech show, which ranked 16th; and 19th place went to a program of movie reviews.” . Steve Gillmor writes back in an essay that is guaranteed to become a classic : “Mainstream media spokesman Frank Barnako announced the death in New York, center of the professional broadcast and financial industries. Barnako, who has owned stock in AOL/Time Warner since 1935, spoke with Winer, Curry, and other leaders of the insurrection at undisclosed locations using approved dominant POTS technology. In related developments, Microsoft Corporation cancelled its rollout of RSS technology in Longhorn, citing Mark Cuban’s assessment that “indies will survive only as a labor of love.” Fired evangelist Robert Scoble, under attack from CNET’s David Berlind and former CNET reporter and analyst/infomercial producer Joe Wilcox, refused to comment pending a review of his current fact-checking procedures, which entail IMing with each of his 7,000 RSS feed publishers for their sign-off on his presumtively erroneous and intensely damaging “facts.” Meanwhile, CNET blogger Steve Gilmor called the death “a seriously lucky thing” given his reluctance to release the last edition of his Gillmore Gang podcast. Gillmour called the final show a “poorly-recorded obscenity-filled miserable ramble” that showed how prescient Ziff Davis columnists John Dvorak and David Coursey have always been in protecting readers and listeners from the dangers of unauthorized and ambiguous sources of dangerous information. “I always knew John and David were right, but I didn’t know why until now,” Gilmorr said. “Normally I would have waited for Lee Gomes to pronounce the body, but Barnako is the Man. Thanks, Frank.” iTunes’ podcasting support will be phased out in the next version, replaced by pay versions of Harry Shearer’s Le Show and NBC’s Meet the Press. NPR officials will return to complaining about loss of federal subsidies, and Jason Calaconis will join the Bush Cabinet as Secretary of Page Views. Karl Rove will continue as Assistant Prevaricator to the President.” See also John Furrier and Shel Holtz on this. Very, very funny stuff . 4. David Weinberger ponders tagging . Referencing Tom Coates , David writes: “Tom Coates does some analysis to illustrate what he suggests is a cultural difference in how people use tags. Some use tags as folders to house objects, others use them as descriptions of objects. (And, it seems to me, many of us do both.) His example: If you tag an URL as “blogs,” you are collecting blogs into a virtual folder. If you tag an URL “blog,” you are describing it as an example of a blog. In the first case, you’re probably putting blogs aside so you can read them. In the second, you may be researching the blog phenomenon. Tom’s research leads him to conjecture that “the folder metaphor is losing ground and the keyword one is currently assuming dominance.”” See also “ Tag entropy: hiding in plain sight ” 5. When will Blogging Peak? Jeremy Zawodny writes “ When will Blogging Peak? ” and says: “While I don’t claim to know or predict the future, I do feel like this whole blogging thing is gonna peak sooner or later. After that it may die off or continue along just fine. But either way I suspect blogging as a “hot thing” can only last so long.” Dave Winer writes back : “First, I don’t think blogging will peak, any more than the telephone will peak. It’s a fundamental way of communicating, if it goes away it will be replaced by something exactly like it. Second, what is a blog? I know this is a long tiresome question, but it matters. The distinction between blog sites that have ads and those that don’t is probably a bigger distinction than between magazines that have ads and blogs that have ads. A blog without ads is itself an ad, interesting to a small number of people. Blogs with ads, like their print counterparts, strive to be as broad as possible, to reach as many people, and in doing so, lose their value as an ad for the author.” See also: Lexblog , paradox1x , Somewhat Frank 6. Wikimania SJ’s Longest Now names every wiki platform he can find . 7. Jeff Jarvis writes about the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 “Web 1.0 is built primarily on the former, the resources and articles and pages and mostly static things: It’s about stuff that sits and is found at an address. It’s about search. It’s about URLs and permalinks. It’s about Google and Yahoo before that. All that is valuable, always will be. But Web 2.0 adds on the wonders of the latter: feeds (RSS, Atom, FeedBurner, et al); lists (OPML, etc.); conversations (blog posts, Technorati links, PubSub feeds, comments); swarming points (tags on Flickr, Del.icio.us, Technorati, Dinnerbuzz); heat sensors (Blogpulse et al); aggregations (e.g., Command-Post.org); communities (Craig’s List, et al); alerts (Craig’s List feeds); decentralized distribution (bittorrent, etc.); and on and on.” See Susan Crawford’s thoughts on this post as well. 8. Seven Words you can’t say in Kindergarten. Nathan Torkington creates a contentious movie about seven words you can’t say in Kindergarten. After you watch it you’ll understand why everyone is talking about it . 9. RSS v. Atom for Dummies Fred at WeBreakStuff.com writes a great comparison essay on RSS and Atom. 10. Want to start a blog and don’t know which service to use? Susannah Gardner took the time to review all major blogging platforms, wrote an excellent article on the subject and created a comparision chart . This is excellent research and a very useful tool. (via Blog Business World ) see also: Yafle , The Language Artist , Qumana Blog 11. Om v. Marc – Did Netscape suck or not? (and oh yeah, 24 hour laundry is coming) Om Malik wrote a post called “ Meeting Marc Andreessen ” and discussed 24 hour laundry, saying absolutely nothing (I hate this – either be stealthy and therefore be quiet or tell us what the heck you are building). He also made a few comments about Netscape, saying: “When noting the â€œfailureï¿½? of Netscape, you might also note these facts: * $600 million in revenue when sold in 1998 * Profitable and cash-generating when sold in 1998 * $350 million in cash and no debt when sold in 1998 * Sold in 1998 for $10 billion * Every private or public shareholder who ever bought a share of NSCP made money if they held through the acquisition and then sold â€” every one” Marc Canter, never a person without an opinion, wrote his thoughts on the subject of Netscape and Marc Andreesen: “The worst abomination ever – single handedly telling us all to fuck off, proving how many diletantes there were there and full of shit they really were. Add to that a) the arrogance, b) the complete ignorance of anything human (at that time called Consumer Internet) and then c) playing this Microsoft’s the bad guy scapegoat game – well believe you me – I’m not the only one who sees Netscape at what it really was. So please – do your revisionist thinking piece – pump up 24 Hour Party People Laundry and hope that Marc’s string of bad luck doesn’t continue. Cause he sure as hell hasn’t done shit since – what 1995?” I was one of Netscape’s corporate attorneys in the late nineties, and worked on many of their large acquisitions, as well as their eventual sale to AOL. While everything Om says is true, Netscape was a huge failure, in the sense of not meeting expectations. It would feel very, very similar if suddenly someone came out with a Google killer and over the course of two years Google use steadily dropped to a fraction of its current use. It seems unthinkable, but that is exactly what happened to Netscape. I’m looking forward to 24 hour laundry , whatever it ends up being. 12. Interview with a search engine SatireWire p osts a very funny interview with Jeeves, of Ask Jeeves. (Via Jeremy Zawodny ) 13. Drink More Beer, Faster I had a very good friend in high school named Brent who’s favorite line at a party was, “the one thing you need to do right now is stop talking and drink more beer, faster.” It always made me laugh, and this post reminded me of those days. “…the TurboTap is such an important invention – pours beer four times faster than existing beer taps at the same time as increasing keg yield by up to 30% and reducing training time to roughly 60 seconds.” Tags: myspace , itunes , alwayson , goingon , beer , tags , tagging , podcasts , podcasting , atom , rss , askjeeves , 24hourlaundry",,2005-07-23 00:00:00

,Profile – Elfurl,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/21/profile-elfurl/,"Service: ElfURL Created: July 20, 2005 What is it? ElfURL went from idea to launch in 4 days . I was reading Alexander Muse’s blog this morning and saw his post on ElfURL: “Last Monday I posted an entry with an idea for a new little Web 2.0 application to replace Tinyurl. Basically I suggested that it would be helpful to have a tool to make long URLs shorter, while at the same time providing a way to apply delicious tags, while at the same time adding statistics on the number of times the URL was accessed, and while having those stats delivered via RSS. I decided that the elves at Weblogs Work should be able to create such a tool and assigned them the task. We decided to call the Web 2.0 application elfURL. The tool is almost complete (the tagging function is not complete and the RSS feed might not be working perfectly). This is what is new about the Web 2.0 – idea to application within four days.” I have been a user of TinyURL for a long time. It’s a neat tool to shorten long URLs into short ones. Alexander’s thought was to take that basic idea behind TinyURL and add some web 2.0 flavor – tagging, stats and RSS. Now, you can (or soon will be able to – the functionality isn’t working yet) add tags to your short URLs, see the number of times the URL was used, and subscribe to the stats via RSS. Cool. As an example of how the stats work, click here to see how many visitors we’ve sent to the site from this post (we converted their URL into an ElfURL ) They’ve also provided a snippet that you can add to a website and include the ElfURL functionality: Enter giant URL: Screen Shots: Relevant Links: Site , Tools , Stats , WeblogsWork , Texas Venture Capital Blog , LikeItMatters (awesome blog with a great name), surferssurf .

,Update: Alwayson (Day Two),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/21/update-alwayson-day-two/,"Event:  AlwaysOn Previous Posts:  July 19, 2005 , July 20, 2005 What’s Happening? Day Two at Always On was hectic. There are two channels here – the main room with panel discussions (see schedule below) and a side room with 5 minute CEO pitches. CEO’s were judged on three areas of their presentations: Opportunity, Go to market strategy and Overall Presentation. Both channels were interesting, and attendees were charging back and forth between rooms all day (us included). CEO Pitches: We saw about half of the CEO pitches. Most interesting/entertaining in our opinion included Pluck (Dave Panos), Rearden Commerce (Patrick Grady), LiveDeal (Rajesh Navar) and Realm (Rick White). We also noticed John Furrier interviewing many CEOs as they finished their pitch. We are looking forward to hearing the podcasts soon. Here’s a picture of John with Dave Panos and Andrew Busey, co-founders of Pluck (TechCrunch profiles ): Main Panels: I thought the Mark Cuban (great picture from JD Lasica)  fireside chat and follow up panel discussion were the best events of the day. If you are interested in hearing John Furrier’s interview with Mark, see Podtech.net here . My notes from the Mark Cuban fireside chat: IceRocket is being renamed blogscour.com. It looks like they are really focusing on prospective search. Mark discussed the differences in the way people search – some people want relevant information, some people want timely information. Google is good at “relevant”, but not timely. Blogscour will focus on timely. Mark quote: “when is the last time the government did something smart…with technology?ï¿½?  “The only people with a worse track record is hollywood” Allen Delattre, the moderator, said “blogs are growing virally” . That’s the first time I’ve heard it put that way. It’s certainly true (but see Jeremy Zavodny yesterday – When will blogging peak?) In the next segment, Mark spoke at length about delivering movies via dvd and in cinemas (and eventually online) all on the same day. This is definitely the future. Mark said he’s learned the most about marketing from four people: Bill Gates, Paris Hilton, Dennis Rodman and Michael Dell. Mark is a good guy and an interesting guy and it was cool having him at the event yesterday. Looking forward to Marc Canter’s GoingOn discussion today.

For anyone who wishes to create, wear, display, sell or celebrate their interests, Zazzle provides a compelling interactive marketplace to a worldwide audience.”  Link Creating Products: Creating products is a relatively straightforward process of choosing prodcuts (apparel, posters, stamps, etc.), uploading images, and pricing the items. Zazzle claims that they have “over 500,000 totally unique, user-created products, available in billions of variations”. Link Zazzle Stamps: Zazzle Stamps is really interesting. Within certain parameters, users can upload their own images, or use stock zazzle images (like disney images), and create actual postage stamps. A sheet of 20 first-class stamps will sell for $16.99, 130% more than “normal” stamps. Zazzle Stamps is possible via a partnership with Pitney Bowes .

,Profile – Simpy,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/18/profile-simpy/,"Company:  Simpy Launched:  May 4, 2004 What is it? Simpy is a social bookmarking service that can be compared to del.icio.us , Furl  Yahoo My Web 2.0  and  others . In their own words, “Simpy is a social bookmarking service. With Simpy, you can save, tag and search your own bookmarks and notes or browse and search other users’ links and tags. You can be open and share your links with others, or keep them private. Simpy also helps you find like-minded people, discover new and interesting sites, publish your bookmarks, detect and eliminate link-rot, etc.” Link Simpy has an excellent user interface and interesting features that the competitors haven’t added. Cool features include full text search of pages (Furl has this as well) and also the ability to find broken links and fix them. We also like the ability to have private, searchable, taggable free text notes on any page. Any bookmark can also be made private. Finally, the ability to add a simpy search box on your blog or other web page (to search your tags) is great. Core Features: – Save and Tag pages with a single click using the Simpy Bookmarklet – Full-text Search bookmarked pages’ content, not just meta-data – Attach searchable notes to bookmarks – Choose between private or public bookmarks – Find people like you and subscribe to their bookmarks – Share your bookmarks with others – Detect broken, forgotten and even redirected bookmarks – Upload your existing bookmarks (Firefox, Mozilla, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, Galeon and Konqueror supported) – Export your bookmarks – Access your bookmarks from any browser and multiple computers – Save private, taggable, and searchable free-text Notes – For hackers: Simpy has an open REST API – use it! – For bloggers: Publish your bookmarks in your blog using RSS or ATOM We’ve spoken with Otis GospodnetiÄ‡ by email over the last couple of weeks and have been told that Simpy will be releasing new features sometime this week . We look forward to seeing what’s coming! In general, we find Simpy’s user interface and search capabilities superior to del.icio.us and Furl. We like the interface for adding bookmarks, and ask only that pages can be bookmarked via a popup like del.icio.us (as an option). The optional additional metadata fields are really useful.

,Profile – Shadows,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/18/profile-shadows/,"Editor’s Note: Today is Social Bookmarking day, with profiles of Simpy and now Shadows. Simpy went out on TechCrunch today because they’ve been releasing new functionality that we really like. Shadows has only been out for a couple of weeks, and will make a public appearance at the AlwaysOn conference at Stanford this week (say hello to me if you are there), and so we thought it was the right time to profile them as well. Service: Shadows Launched: Two weeks ago Located: Austin, TX (this is a Pluck company) What is it? Pluck is up to something, and we like it . Last week they released version 2.0 of their Firefox extension (see our profile ), which we are still drooling over (it’s fast ). Two weeks ago they very quietly launched Shadows, which is a social bookmarking site. Our understanding from Dave Panos, their CEO, and Andrew Busey, the co-founder, is that they will be publicly announcing Shadows this week at AlwaysOn in Stanford. As we mentioned with Simpy , Shadows should be compared to other social bookmarking sites like del.icio.us , Furl , Yahoo My Web 2.0 , and  others . Shadows has a single drawback: they absolutely require an IE or firefox toolbar installation in order to bookmark pages on the fly. This takes up valuable screen real estate and is generally annoying. However, the functionality more than makes up for the real estate loss – this is a toolbar we are going to keep , and there’s a good reason. Not only does the toolbar allow saving and tagging of pages, but it also allows you to view a “shadow page” of the current URI. The shadow page shows tags added by users, comments and other meta-data, which is very useful. Here is content from the shadow page for Techcrunch (which is somewhat biased since as of now we are the only user to have added meta-data for Techcrunch:-)): Link Shadows seems to have all of the high end functionality of the other social bookmarking services (with the exception of a server cache of the site?). One thing we haven’t figured out – there is an ability to add friends but we don’t know what functionality comes with adding friends since users set bookmars as either public or private. We like the delicious and furl-like popup up when bookmarking a page: They also have shadow pages, as mentioned above, and a nifty feature called “ ubertags “, which are pre-defined tags like experts, cool, etc., many of which we have attributed to TechCrunch, of course. Overall, Shadows is very cool and we look forward to the official launch.

,Profile – Doostang,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/17/profile-doostang/,"Editor’s Note: Writing this from Luxembourg airport. Free and strong wifi. Awesome. Company:  Doostang Location: Doostang, Inc. 160 Brannan St. Suite 306 San Francisco, CA 94107 E-mail: contact@doostang.com Launched: Recently What is it? Doostang is a trust network and employment service. Once you have joined, you can post a profile, upload a resume, post and search for jobs, write testimonials and invite other people. You can join by invitation only. If you would like an invitation, email us (see our about section) and we will be happy to send you one. In their own words, “Doostang is the trusted professional network. The network grows by invitation only which ensures that all contacts that enter the system are trusted by at least one or more members in the network. The value of the network grows with time as the number of contacts increases. The initial goal of Doostang is to fix the quality vs. quantity gap in online recruiting and job searching. Over 50% of recruiting today is done through the personal network of contacts and a large portion of which is done by email communication. Using your personal network is the most effective way to find the right candidate for a position and to find the perfect job. It eliminates the need to either post a job to an irrelevant audience or to search through the multitude of jobs available on the Internet or newspapers that would be of no interest to you. Doostang provides the infrastructure to connect personal networks together and to create a natural quality filter for recruiting and job searching. Doostang hails from two Farsi words, “doost” which means friend, and “tang” a word used to symbolize the trust between a close group of people. Farsi, one of the world’s oldest languages dating back to 600BC, was spoken from the borders of India in the far east and Russia and China in the north, to southern shores of the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean in the west. The word Doostang fittingly describes our company’s long term goal to be the trusted professional network.” Link The site works in similar ways to LinkedIn , in that you choose your trust network (friends), can interact with them, post testimonials, etc. There are two important differences. The first difference is that you can only become a member via an invitation. That does create an atmosphere of exclusivity. The second difference is that the jobs seem to be very high quality. Nivi mentioned this in a comment conversation we were having in his post about Doostang and I have to say I agree with him – the quality level is at this time very high. We like Doostang and will continue to build our network at the site.

,Web 2.0 This Week (July 10 – 16),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/16/web-20-this-week-july-10-16/,"The main Web 2.0 news this week focused on Technorati (is it dyin or is it rockin?) and the release of Atom 1.0. Lots of other random and interesting stuff as well, including important chia-pet news. Weekly Summary: 1. Technorati is Dead! Long Live Technorati! Technorati has dominated web 2.0 news this week. Posts come at it from three different but related angles: – Technorati’s traffic has lately been dominating the competition, and they are getting a lot of press as well . See no. 5 from last week’s wrapup . Richard MacManus again noted Technorati’s ascension in a post this week called “ Technorati for President “, and cited a recent Wired Magazine article on them that barely mentioned that they have any competition. Richard writes “You’ve got to hand it to Technorati, they sure know how to get media and blog attention. A recent Wired article makes the extraordinary claim that Technorati is “a public utility on a global scale”. With no mention whatsoever of other blog search engines, Wired compares Technorati to Google…” – Jason Calcanis launches his “Off with their Head” campaign against Technorati (and other blog search engines) . See Jason’s cry for Google and Yahoo to launch blog search engines here and follow up here . See Blog Herald’s counter-point here . – Discussion over the overall demise of Technorati, its index and its interface . Doc Searls gives a massive overview here . More Points of View: Dave Sifry , Syntagma , Frank Gruber , BusinessWeek , Blog Herald , ChrisWere.com , WeBreakStuff , Jeremy Wright , Jeremy Wright #2 , Newest Industry , Hans on Experience , Scoble , David Berlind , David Berlind #2 2. RSS v. Atom – Tim Bray posts a comparative chart From Alex Bosworth , “The differences are posed in such a way as to show how Atom is superior, and as Don Park has pointed out some points might be half-truths or misleading , but generally I think it details the differences between Atom and RSS. The problem is that Atom has serious failings which all stem from the same cause – Atom is made for consumers, not producers.” See also: Rogers Cadenhead , Tris Hussey and John Udell . 3. Steve Gillmor – Once you go RSS, you never go back . “How many people, once they switched to AOL on Live8 Day, went back? The same number who switched back from RSS. My friend still hasn’t fired up Bloglines, or Rojo, or iTunes for that matter. But he will. That I’m sure of. It’s a matter of time.” He mentioned this in a Gillmor gang podcast too. I totally agree. I’ve shown many people how to use RSS. They are all religous about it now. 4. Nivi – “RSS is the TCP/IP Packet of Web 2.0” David Beisel comments here . 5. Dan Cornish – “RSS is Like TV” “RSS is starting to feel like television. I sit in front of the tv with a remote and click through 100 channels and then say “nothing is on.” In a comment to a Fred Wilson post. Via Michael Parekh . 6. Net Rage – Blogging Sucks Catalyst released a report at the link above that basically says people don’t get blogging and RSS yet, and we have a long way to go to get there. It’s just us geeks and wannabe geeks for now. “Even assuming mainstream interest, current blog design standards â€“ at least in terms of navigation, nomenclature and taxonomy â€“ are a barrier to consumer acceptance. In fact, the design of most blogs can incite net rage” See also BW , BloggersBlog and BlogHerald . 7. 5 Million Bloggers in China “Of the 100 million mainland internet users, 5 million are bloggers and about 2 million have blog accounts with Bokee.” Our understanding is that 2 players in China have about 80% of the market. via BlogHerald . 8. Yahoo’s HotJobs adds scraped jobs to paid listings . There’s been a ton written about this over the last week. Basically, Yahoo’s HotJobs is now scraping job sites for job listings and adding them to it’s paid listings. It had to – it’s being squeezed by the paid guys (see Monster.com) and the new scrapers like Indeed. What we’d really like to see is companies set up their jobs page with an RSS feed. Seems obvious and would avoid all this scraping nonsense. See Business2.0 , SiliconBeat , Greg Sterling , Charlene Li , Zeremy Zawodny . 9.

,Profile – Pluck (For Firefox),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/16/profile-pluck-for-firefox/,"Company:  Pluck (For Firefox) Launch Date: June 13, 2005 (2.0 Beta for Firefox) What is it? Pluck has a number of excellent products, including a web based RSS reader that competes with Bloglines, NewsGator and others (see our Bloglines v. Newsgator post ) as well as an IE plugin that is very popular. They’ve also quietly launched a social bookmarking site called Shadows that will have increased functionality added next week. Pluck has been testing a plugin for Firefox for a couple of months, and released the 2.0 Beta on Wednesday. It has been very well received (over 3,000 downloads so far). It’s this product, the Firefox 2.0 beta, that is being profiled here. Quick Summary: Its awesome because it is feature rich and faster than any aggregator I’ve seen. It also seems to update feeds quite fast. I will switch to permanently this from Bloglines as soon as the updated features are launched. This is a Firefox extension, so the download is quick and, unlike their IE plugin, most of the work is done at the server level. The product is therefore much more like their “web edition” than “Pluck for IE”. Importing feeds via OPML was a snap. I was able to quickly organize them into folders and generally get set up. I spoke with Matthew Bookspan at Pluck about the product yesterday (Pluck was also nice enough to offer for us to be a beta tester a month ago but we failed miserably in following up). See Matt’s blog post on the release of the product here . Matt assures us that those few features that we found lacking are on the bug/feature list to be added soon. Features: – Syncronizes feeds automatically accross all Pluck Products – easy feed import via OPML – works well with tabbed browsing (open feeds in tabs) – publish/share folders – bolds feeds with new content – choices on RSS feed updates – seems to run very, very fast – easy to save posts/clippings – notification of feed updates â€“ a little toast window above the pluck icon in the status bar: Upcoming Features: – show number of subscribers per feed – show number of unread items within a feed – check all as “read” – syncing of read/unread accross Pluck Products (one of the biggest problems in the industry right now) Additional Screen Shots: Management: Dave Panos – Chief Executive Officer (co-founder) Andrew Busey – Executive Vice President (co-founder) Link Investors: Austin Ventures Mayfield Link Relevant Links: Pluck Blog , About , New Features , Discussion Forum , Trevor’s Blog , Feed Readers Watch Tags: Pluck , Firefox , RSS , Atom , RSSReaders , Techcrunch , Web2.0",Pluck,2005-07-16 00:00:00
,Update – Feedburner (Buzzboost),https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/15/update-feedburner-buzzboost/,"Company:  FeedBurner (BuzzBoost) Location: Chicago Previous Profiles:  June 14, 2005 , July 4, 2005 What’s New? FeedBurner has been launching a ton of new features lately, and BuzzBoost, announed on July 11 , is worth noting. In their own words, “Enter BuzzBoost. It’s the latest publicity and awareness offering for FeedBurner publishers, and it’s free. BuzzBoost’s job is to redisplay your feed content anywhere you can copy and paste a short snippet of HTML code â€” in a Blogger or TypePad page template, on a corporate website, or even in a “signature” block on a message board. BuzzBoost code is just a short line of JavaScript that displays content items and information from a FeedBurner feed according to settings you provide. You get to control how BuzzBoost displays the following elements: * Feed Title * Item publication date * Individual item headlines, headlines and plain text, or headlines and original HTML * Plain text item excerpt length * Link to download podcast enclosures (if available) We know that publishers who are familiar with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) would also want to precisely control the styling of whatever BuzzBoost generates. Therefore, BuzzBoost has the right hooks in the generated HTML to make sure you can style each of BuzzBoost’s elements, which we have documented (see the links at the bottom of this post.)” Link Tris Hussey at Qumana posted about this a few days ago and saw the power of it immediately – you can cross promote blogs, and use any RSS feed in new ways. For instance, Tris is thinking about taking RSS feeds of prospective search queries and promoting them through buzzboost – very creative! This isn’t new technology, it’s just a very easy and cool implementation. Feedburner will create an html script for you based on your parameters, or you can take the source html and entirely customize it. To use it, if you already have burned feeds at Feedburner, click on “publicize” from the control panel area, and choose “buzzboost”. You can then select certain parameters, and choose a standard snippet or take the html and edit it directly: snippet: full Code: Here’s how it looks in action: Subscribe to RSS headline updates from: TechCrunch Powered by FeedBurner Relevant Links: Tris Hussey line of site Brad Feld java girl Blog Sites Net Tech Based Marketing quick online tips Tags: feedburner , buzzboost , rss , techcrunch , web2.0",FeedBurner,2005-07-15 00:00:00
,Profile – Judy'S Book,https://techcrunch.com/2005/07/15/profile-judys-book/,"Company:  Judy’s Book Launched: July 2005 Location: Seattle, WA What is it? Judy’s Book is a site that allows people to write reviews of local businesses. It also has social networking features (adding friends, groups, etc.) to share reviews with a trust network. The idea is that people trust what their friends think more than advertising. The reviews are easy to write, with lots of structure (rating, cost, pros/cons) and free text areas that will make searching easier (no tags though – they’ll add that soon enough). It is somewhat like DinnerBuzz , without the tagging and with more social networking. They don’t discuss in on the site, but they clearly use the yahoo mapping api or some other datebase for business search. In their own words, “Judy’s Book was started in 2004 by Andy Sack and Chris DeVore. When Andy and his wife Alexa moved to Seattle, Alexa’s mom — Judy -â€“ gave them her ‘little green book’, her personal take on the best service providers in Seattle. Andy and Alexa relied on Judy’s book for help and advice as they settled into their new city. When Chris and his wife Emily needed a handyman, Andy passed along a recommendation from Judy’s book and an idea was born: why not create a ‘little green book’ for busy parents everywhere? Judy’s Book is the result â€“ offering local answers by parents, for parents. Join today and see for yourself!”  Link Here is a visual of a review: To get the content rolling, Judy’s book is offering bribes. :-) Five reviews gets you $5 at Starbucks, and 50 reviews + 10 friend invites gets you an iPod shuffle. Good idea. Great site. But its another social networking tool to keep updated…and therefore will have some traction issues. The site does not provide RSS feeds for searches or tagging…They’ll realize the usefullness of that soon enough and add it. (Andy and Chris, if you read this, check out Dinnerbuzz and see the things they are doing correctly – it will be easy for you to add this functionality) :-) Founders: Andy Sack Chris DeVore Relvant Links: About Search Engine Watch Surfers Surf , Greg Yardley Tags: judysbook , yellowpages , localsearch , search , reviews , profiles , techcrunch , web2.0 , socialnetworks",,2005-07-15 00:00:00
,Attensa – The Smart Rss Reader,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/29/attensa-the-smart-rss-reader/,"Attensa is a world class RSS reader that is attacking the multi-platform syncronization problem (I’ll explain that) and is also looking very seriously at the attention issue from a unique perspective (a good thing). Attensa launched their first product at Gnomedex in June – an Outlook based reader that is lightning fast and has been getting rave reviews (Jeff Nolan). It’s also free, for now. Attensa for Outlook supports enclosures, and so will automatically download things like podcasts and videocasts. Since it syncs with outlook, all content will be available for you to read when you are offline. This is a key feature for people who travel and aren’t online constantly, but want to be able to catch up on their feeds. Attensa for Outlook is just the beginning, however. I spoke with Scott Niesen, Attensa’s Marketing Director, this evening and heard about their future product plans. In a “couple of weeks” Attensa will be launching a private beta of their web-based RSS reader. It will fully syncronize your feeds with their outlook product. It will also fully syncronize at the post level , meaning if you’ve read a post on one product, it will not show up as unread in the other product. This is a key product feature and possible because Attensa’s engine runs at the server level for both products. Duplicate posts are a huge problem for power RSS users, and Attensa is making a serious attempt to solve this. I’ll be included in the beta testing and Scott tells me that I can blog freely on the product, including screen shots. More on this when the product is soft-launched. Later this year Attensa will roll out a mobile reader as well, rounding out the product set nicely. For now, all products are free. Attensa has been polling users to create an appropriate long-term pricing plan. Their current plan is to keep the web product free, and eventually charge a one time fee of $20 for the Outlook client. If a user want to use both products and syncronize feeds, Attensa will charge a yearly subscription fee of about $20 (but you won’t be charged for the Outlook client). $20 a year for this kind of high end product seems pretty reasonable to me. No word from Attensa yet on their pricing plans for the mobile product, but I assume it would be rolled in with the subscription plan. Attensa is looking at the Attention issue very carefully. About half of my call with Scott was spent discussing their plans in this area. They have a unique perspective on the opportunity. For a full discussion, see co-founder Eric Hayes post on his personal blog . Basically, Attensa will (with your opt-in permission) aggregate information about your reading habits to make your feed reading more efficient ( something needs to be done to make it possible to mow through hundreds and hundreds of feeds every day) . Their idea? Watch what you read, what you click on, how long you spend reading something, what you ignore (just as important), and prioritze feeds and posts according to what they think you’ll want to read first. They’ll also suggest new feeds based on what you seem to be liking. I, for one, am more than happy to give up a little privacy if I get efficiency and good recommendations in return.

,Top Ten Things You Can Do To Get Blogged,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/08/top-ten-things-you-can-do-to-get-blogged/,"Our primary goal here at TechCrunch is to profile new web 2.0 companies. Finding and experiencing what new companies have to offer is exciting for us. It what gets us up in the morning. We are honestly deeply passionate about this stuff. Usually, the passion, drive and intelligence of the creators is reflected in the company or product they create. And even if a product is very young and/or doesn’t necessarily have a high chance for commercial success, there are usually features that carry our mutual thinking on web 2.0 further along. We try very hard to dig for those forward-thinking features and highlight them on this site. Doing one thing in a spectacular and inspiring fashion and nine things stupidly is far, far better than doing ten things “well”. “Well” is boring. We find new companies primarily in three ways. First, we scour hundreds of blog and news feeds daily to see whatâ€™s new. Second, we get a number of tips (often anonymously) about new stuff â€“ usually these are the most interesting new products. The third way is a direct request from the company itself. We receive on average 5-10 email requests a day to be profiled. Usually we’ll write about one of these, meaning if a company sends in an email request to be profiled, they have a 10-20% chance of getting up on the site. This is not a hard rule but more of an observation. I believe that if more companies approached us differently, a much higher percentage would be blogged. I’ve decided to humbly submit my advice on how to approach us in requesting a profile – I think this advice will work well with other bloggers as well. Please comment and tell me what I’ve missed.",,2005-09-08 00:00:00
,Feedburner'S New Design,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/feedburners-new-design/,"Last week, FeedBurner announced a significant redesign of their site. I didn’t post on it right away because the basic stats functionality remains the same. People are generally  quite  happy with the change. And I have to say FeedBurner is one of my favorite tools – without it I would have a very difficult time understanding how much of our traffic was coming through our RSS feed. Overall, however, though I don’t think the redesign was a success. I am finding that I am clicking (and waiting) much more often than I was previously to find the stats I care about (24 hour recap and item readership stats). Too much information is available only through secondary pages. A better  information architecture would make that information more readily available. I also think the site is a full generation behind the state of the art – adding ajax would speed things up somewhat and significantly reduce necessary clicks and refreshes. Some of the applications I am beta testing quite frankly make FeedBurner look very bad in comparison. fiftyfoureleven has additional thoughts as well. I am a big fan of FeedBurner, so take this criticism very lightly. 99% of what they do, they do extremely well, and frankly that is (mostly) all that matters. We’ve written previously about FeedBurner on July 15, 2005 , July 4, 2005 and June 14, 2005 .",FeedBurner,2005-09-07 00:00:00
,Memeorandum Is Exceptional,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/18/memeorandum-is-exceptional/,"I’ve been using Memeorandum for about a month (since Bar Camp in August). Gabe Rivera, the creator, gave me a private demo and set up a demo site for me (no longer active). Like Robert Scoble , I was hooked immediately. Memeorandum is the result of Gabe’s frustration with tracking blogger conversations about a given topic. Search engine weren’t producing intelligent results, and links from blogs didn’t tell the full story. So like any good entrepreneur, he set out to tackle the problem. And boy did he come up with a compelling solution. It’s one of those sites you just keep coming back to, every day. Memeorandum is a way to track blog conversations relating to political or tech issues (Gabe can and probably will add additional verticals in the future) in a highly effective manner. When you go to the site you see what is being talked about the most in the blogsphere at that moment. The most highly linked articles appear at the top and in bigger font sizes. Less popular items are below. Super-popular items eventually are pushed down as newer popular stuff goes up. Here’s how it works: A post is written. People start to link to it. If enough people link and it becomes very popular, it goes up in the “New Item Finder” area in the top right. If more people link, it will go up in the main area. If a link includes conversation and discourse (substantial text in addition to the link), the linking blog is noted underneath the popular post. All of this is automated, which is the really beautiful part of the service. Memeorandum is very low noise, too. It tracks about 2,000 blogs today – only content from those blogs comes up on the site. Yes, it’s a limitation, but it results in very relevant and high quality results. Gabe will add more quality blogs over time. It sounds complicated, but it is a very useful way to monitor conversations about popular things going on in the blogosphere. Things went crazy last week, for instance, when Google launched its blog search engine. Memeorandum sorted it all out, in near real time (it updates every 5 minutes), and presented the information in a logical way.

We previously wrote about Measure Map here and Heather Green also wrote about it here . Measure Map is an extremely useful tool for bloggers. It uses ajax and flash intelligently. Integration is very simple (adding a javascript snippet into the blog template). It provides detailed analytics on every aspect of your blog – how readers get to your site, what they read, whether they comment and what links they use to leave. We can’t post screen shots or feature comparisons yet, but I will say this: tools like Measure Map, Mint , and Feedburner that track blog analytics are extremely useful. They take a much needed step past existing server log analyzers. Not only are the statistics much more readily available (and real time), but they also provide very granular data on exactly the areas bloggers care about – things like comments, trackbacks, links in and out, etc. The conversation aspect of blogs. Anyway, Measure Map is evolving and stats are erratic this weekend. I realized just how much I’ve grown to rely on it when it wasn’t fully available to me.

The key value-add is their recommendation engine – you rate media and get recommendations based on your ratings v. ratings by other community members (it works in the same way that Netflix recommends new movies to you). In addition to substantial visual improvements, Loomia has added tagging of media, creating a great new way to find podcasts and videocasts of relevant content. Check out Loomia – it’s free and it’s the best resource we know about for finding new podcasting and videocasting content.",Loomia,2005-09-16 00:00:00
,Editorial: On Mash-Ups,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/16/editorial-on-mash-ups/,"Mash-ups, or the use of distinctive services for the creation of new and interesting applications, are one of the most interesting concepts behind the Web 2.0 phenomenon. Here on Techcrunch, we’re always up for the challenge of talking about innovation with services and apps, so we have decided to start covering Mash-ups more frequently. What this means is that besides the profiles and articles you’re already used to reading on the site, we’ll be talking about the cool stuff people are building by combining the platforms companies like Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Ebay and everyone else are setting up. This is a fascinating field, in a quite fascinating era for computing. This being said, and since we are always up to see what our readers are doing, feel free to send in comments or emails about what you find interesting about the Web 2.0, mashups, platform services or anything you believe fits on Techcrunch. We’re ready to listen to what you have to say, and we’re definitely up to seeing what cool projects and products you are all working on.",,2005-09-16 00:00:00
,Netvibes – Personal Homepage,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/16/netvibes-personal-homepage/,"Netvibes, a project started in France by Florant Fremont, is the latest web-app based on the idea of personalized homepages and like some others (like Start and Google’s personal homepage ), it is powered by some nicely developed Ajax. Their goal is best put in their own words, so quoting their blog post about the launch on the 8th september, The project itself looks pretty good: modules are intuitive and the page interaction’s easy to catch up on with just a few seconds. There are a few other things on the slate too, apparently, like modules for Flickr, feed searching, bookmarks, etc (a proper list is available on their blog ). All in all, while it is another solution for a problem that many people are tackling, Netvibes looks like a pretty good Ajax-based homepage, so you should definitely check it out and take your conclusions.

Due to its nature it is OSX Tiger only – even though with Yahoo Widgets it shouldn’t be much work to have something going for Windows too – but if you run it on your machine, make sure you check it out. It’s always good to see companies embrace new capabilities of operating systems and being creative with them.

,Pluck Expands Product Line,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/16/pluck-expands-product-line/,"Pluck ( previous  profiles ) is quietly building a very nice suite of web 2.0 products (see Shadows as well). They announced two new products on September 12 – InSite RSS and InSite Blogging. Both products are aimed at online content publishers, particularly online newspapers. Both can generate significant revenue for Pluck, as they charge for these services. Pluck also announced their first customer for these products. I spoke with Dave Panos, the CEO of Pluck, via email about these products and their first customer deal. InSite RSS is a tool to allow sites to integrate RSS feed content directly into their websites, adding significant stickiness to their users. With InSite Blogging, site users/readers can create their own blogs. For sites with a local focus, like online newspapers, this can be a very effective tool for adding stickiness, as well as increasing content creation on local issues. While editorial control can be an issue (as the LA Times found out quite painfully), this can be a way for newspapers with an online presence to stop the customer bleeding they’ve had to suffer over the years. Pluck also announced their first customer for Insite Blogging – The Austin American-Statesman, a Cox newspaper and Central Texas’ leading daily newspaper (it basically owns Austin). The blogging sites can be seen here and here . An example blog (lots have sprung up after only a few days) can be seen here (see screen shot also). Library Clips and Outsell Now also blogs about Pluck’s new products. Congratulations to Pluck. If they can get traction in this space, there is a real revenue opportunity for these products.",Pluck,2005-09-16 00:00:00
,Yahoo Releases Instant Search,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/15/yahoo-releases-instant-search/,"Yahoo announced  Instant Search last night (more info on this landing page ). Like Google Suggest and Snap , Yahoo has added ajax functionality to search. It’s different, though. Google Suggest and Snap use ajax to suggest search queries based on what you’ve typed in so far, whereas Yahoo has integrated basic search results into the interface. This means you can get answers to simple and popular searches (like weather) without a page refresh. Try it out . Yahoo suggests queries such as “Boston Weather” and “Wikipedia”. This type of search gives good results. And Yahoo takes a small swipe at Google by saying “â€œWhy feel lucky when you can be right”, a reference to Google’s Feeling Lucky button.

,Profile – Last.Fm,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/15/profile-lastfm/,"Company:  Last.fm Location: London Launched: 2002, redesigned in 2005 With applications like Pandora ( profile ) getting some attention from the blogosphere, it’s time to shed some light on another music-related project that’s been around for some time now and that I’m quite fond of – Last.fm . Last FM (now merged with the Audioscrobbler project) allows you to generate a profile of your musical taste based on what you like or listen to the most. Here’s how they put it: Last.fm, like Pandora, suggests bands and tracks based on your current taste, but it is Last.fm’s social network-based approach that makes it interesting. Last.fm generates recommendations from your musical tastes by compiling a list of your musical neighbours (people who listen to the same things you do) and suggests bands they also play and that you don’t. This organically built ecosystem of relationships between people and their musical tastes is what makes Last.fm stand out from the competition. Being out there for longer also has its advantages like the huge user-base and the amazing extra capabilities of the system like the stand-alone player, that keeps playing new music for you until you grow tired of being suddenly so musically rich and go back to your own tracks. A lot else could be said about Last.fm because I’m one of those guys who’s completely in love with the system but there’s nothing like the joy of discovery, so I’m going to leave it to you to click this link and explore it yourself . People who are curious about the architectural diferences between Last.fm and Pandora can read this post on my personal blog , that talks about just that. And if you’re really curious, you can check out my own profile up at Last.fm.",Pandora; Last.fm,2005-09-15 00:00:00
,Google Blog Search – First Impressions,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/14/google-blog-search-first-impressions/,"Google Blog Search  launched last night and hit the blogospere by storm. We’ve had a chance to bang on it for most of the night and morning and have a few things to report. Overall, Google Blog Search is a very worthy addition to the ranks of blog search engines. The search is completely separate from normal Google search. It can be accessed in three ways, although the back end service is the same regardless of how you access it: Advanced search options can be viewed here . Blogs that use a ping server such as Weblogs.com ( profile ) have been indexed since June 2005, so older posts are not included in the index. The engine generally points to posts only, although if there is a good match to your query for an entire blog, Google points to the blog above normal search results (see screen shot below). You can used the advanced search features to restrict search to certain languages (35 supported languages). Additional information can be found in the FAQs . The interface is clean. The engine is unquestionably fast. About as fast as normal Google searches. However, since their indes only goes back to June, it is unfair to compare it to existing blog search engines. Google is indexing posts by crawling the XML feeds rather than the post html . This allows for significantly more structured data (date, author, categorites, etc.). However, if the XML feed only includes a summary of the post (as very many do), the full text of the post will not be indexed (and therefore cannot be searched). Relevant information will not be found. Speed is a crucial issue and if they can maintain current search speeds over time, it will be a very large competitive advantage. Search results can be sorted by date or “relevance”. Sorting by relevance is the default. A few people are noting deficiencies in the current product. Richard MacManus says: David Sifry (CEO of Technorati) gives more detail , saying: Overall, significant room for improvement exists. Google Blog Search is fast and the ability to sort by relevance or date is an important features. However, Google search is not a category killer like the original Google search was. Competitors took a much expected hit today, but they are still standing.",Google,2005-09-14 00:00:00
,Meebo – Instant Messaging With Ajax,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/14/meebo-instant-messaging-with-ajax/,"Meebo, an ajax-rich web-based instant messenger application, launched today. It’s elegant and useful. There are a number of problems with instant messaging. First, most of us have too many client applications to run at one time (skype, msn, AOL, Yahoo, Google Talk, Meetro, etc…) (solutions like Trillian attempt to solve this). Second, if you are away from your base computer, you may not be able to access the software needed to run IM. Meebo solves this by allowing you to log into AOL, ICQ, MSN and Yahoo instant messaging services from their web page. Since Meebo uses ajax, you can drag and drop the message boxes around the screen. And the core functionality (making IM more useful and easy to use) is quite nice. There are things that they can improve on – support for emoticons is the first to come to mind. One problem that they can’t overcome, but which users should be aware of, is that Meebo is taking (and can store) your IM usernames and password. Any Meebo employee (and hacker) with database access could obtain these credentials and use or change them. Something to be aware of. Also, Meebo should be supporting Jabber even in this public alpha product. Jabber is an open protocol and should therefore be the easiest service to implement. By supporting Jabber, Meebo would allow you to access Google Talk ( profile ) as well. This was pointed out in a comment by Frederico Oliveira on an UneasySilence post on Meebo earlier today.

,Searchfox – Personalized Rss Reader,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/12/searchfox-personalized-rss-reader/,"SearchFox is in private beta testing of a potentially disruptive RSS reader. It’s the first product I’ve seen that does a good job of prioritizing new content from feeds based on your historical reading behavior, as well as data gathered from the SearchFox community as a whole. This is a very big problem that I’ve written about many times. RSS readers are great for sorting through content, up to a point – after a couple of hundred feeds there is simply too much information to go through quickly. Companies are now trying to tackle the problems faced by the power users – those reading hundreds of feeds daily, in the hope that in solving their problems they will create a product that addresses the needs of the masses as well. Since they are in private beta, you’ll need to request an invitation to try the product out now. Esteban Kozak at Search Fox tells me they still have a few left, but they have almost invited the quota. There are a number of preset feeds when you log in for the first time, which I promptly deleted. Adding new feeds was fairly simple – no problems with adding feeds one at a time. Although there is functionality to import an opml file (the standard file format for RSS feeds), I was not able to successfully import my file. I’ll be trying again and it may be an issue on my end. I’ve only been using it for a couple of days, but I am already seeing how the prioritization works and I’m fairly happy with the decisions it is making. Estaban tells me via email that after a couple of weeks of use the results will be even better: Search Fox also has a nice interface – inlcuding easy links to save, mark as read, email link, and delete. One of my favorite features is the ability to expand or contract a post without a page refresh. Robert Scoble wrote about Search Fox last week, and Matt Marshall mentioned them briefly as well. You should also check out TechBlog, which does an excellent comparison of a number of web based readers, including Search Fox. The Search Fox blog is here .

,Zimbra – Web/Ajax Based Outlook,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/12/zimbra-webajax-based-outlook-application/,"We saw that really well done Ajax web applications like Writely can open people’s eyes to the future of the computing and the place that web 2.0 has in that future. When you first view the Zimbra demo you may have a similar experience. Zimbra is, basically, a web based outlook/iCal/Thunderbird application in the same way that Writely is a web based version of Word. There are some core differences between how Zimbra and Writely approach their respective markets, however. Writely is a proprietary, hosted application (although they import and export in Word and other formats). Zimbra is an open source project, and is presented only in demo form at this point – if you want to run it you have to do so on your own servers. So while Zimbra is not something you can immediately start using, you can view a hosted demo here and a flash demo here . The source code is available on the download page here .

,The Ugly (But Necessary?) Side Of Wikipedia,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/the-ugly-but-necessary-side-of-wikipedia/,"As I’ve written before, I like wikipedia a lot. I link to it often. And it’s getting very big : But the free and open editing system can be ugly at times, and tonight I saw something very ugly. I saw the movie Ray today and really enjoyed learning more about Ray Charles’ life. After the movie I sat down at my laptop and looked him up on Wikipedia (and fired up the iPod to listen to more of his music). The Wikipedia Ray Charles entry is quite good, informative and interesting. But as I read further, I saw the following: Note the last word in the image above – possibly the most vile and hateful word in our language. Since anyone, ANYONE, can edit wikipedia (I’ve written entries myself), there are no real-time controls on this kind of abuse. It’s the beauty of Wikipedia, and its most often heard criticism. My first question is, how can someone smart enough to use a computer and edit a wiki be so ignorant as to write something so horrible? My second question is, what, if anything, can Wikipedia do to stop these kinds of things from happening and yet retain the complete editorial openness that they have today? Wikipedia recently announced that they will be experimenting with new editorial rules to stop things like this. Maybe this will help. I think one thing they should consider is a simple dictionary filter of questionable words…and freeze those edits until someone can review them. Character recognition technology is advanced enough now that this will work for words in images too. Some good news – the entry was amended and the word removed in the time it took me to write this post (I just checked). Good. Maybe I just came accross it during the few minutes (I hope) that it was up on the site.",Wikipedia,2005-09-07 00:00:00
,85% Of College Students Use Facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/,"Company:  FaceBook Launched: February 4, 2004 Status: Funded by Peter Thiel and Accel Partners Employees: 32 in Palo Alto, 4 in Boston Location: Palo Alto I’ve long been intrigued by FaceBook , the fantastically popular social network site for college and university students. FaceBook raised about $500,000 from Peter Thiel in an angel round, and $12.2 million from Accel Partners in April 2005 (at a rumored valuation of around $100 million). I’ve read the  articles that describe a vibrant and growing social network, but lamented that I simply could not get in to it! To get past the login page you need a valid .edu college/university email address, and I am not a college student. More news came out last Friday, September 2. FaceBook began allowing high school students to join the network, significantly increasing their target market. I emailed FaceBook over the weekend and requested an interview. Chris Hughes wrote back and said he’d be delighted. We spoke today. And Chris, great guy that he is, gave me access to the site via a demo account. I was finally able to see what FaceBook was all about. By the way, the screen shot above is the demo account profile. The Kramer picture is a nice touch, I think. This will be a longer than normal post since most of us can’t simply try the service out for ourselves. I’ve organized my notes under the subjects of “membership,” “functionality,”  and “business model”. To become a college member of facebook you must have a .edu college/university email address. Most colleges issue these to students. Facebook supports 882 colleges today – there are about 2,000 in the U.S. if you count community colleges. Their goal is to support all of these over time. The penetration rate is staggering – about 85% of students in supported colleges have a profile up on FaceBook. That’s 3.85 million members . Chris tells me that 60% log in daily . About 85% log in at least once a week, and 93% log in at least once a month. With the addition of high schools – there are approximately 22,000 in the U.S., Facebook’s target market increases substantially. Chris tells me “tens of thousands” of high school students have joined since the functionality was launched last friday. Becoming a member as a high school student is a bit easier. High schools generally do not issue email addresses, and so there is no requirement for an active .edu email account. Current high school members can invite others. Once you start college, you have the opportunity to change the account over to whatever school you attend. Also, Chris tells me that recent alums (who can remain members) are maintaining the same log in rates as current members. The demo account profile can be viewed here . In addition to  basic personal information, users are encouraged to add additional descriptive information about themselves to build out their identity. Users can add favorite music, books, movies, quotes, etc. Every entry is linked to search results where users can see others who share the same interests. Users can also form and/or join groups. Examples are political and social groups. However, about 80% are “fun” related, such as “I love NY”. Additional functionality includes events (party notices, etc.) and messages (email). Users can interact in a number of ways. You can add friends (must be mutually accepted), and you can also “poke” another member, which is a way of saying “hello”. The biggest use of the site appears to be dating…as you can see from this very funny independent movie that I found on FaceBook. It’s long, but I highly recommend it if you are trying to get a feel for the service. FaceBook has three methods of producing revenue.

Example is here . RSS feeds today are a pain – you either need to include tons of subscription buttons to make it easier on people who don’t fully understand what the “XML” button means, or rely on autodiscovery of feeds, which seems to break as often as it works. I spend a lot of time with aggregators requesting that they re-cache the feeds on TechCrunch, and it is still an ongoing project. SoloSub is a step in the right direction. It adds a step to the process of subscribing to a feed (users click on the solosub icon and then choose their reader), but the extra step is worth it.

There is definitely something interesting about the service, and it will be worth checking out once it goes live. For now, you can view low quality screen shots on the home page and view a flash presentation that includes additional information. The uniqueness of Fooky lies in its approach to artificial intelligence and natural language commands, as well as a clean interface: Ed is also thinking ahead to the mobile market and the need for simple text and voice input mechanisms: It’s too early to point the thumb up or down for Fooky, but we look forward to seeing the live service. In the meantime, I highly recommend running the flash presentation in 4-5 browser windows simultaneously.

In the notes section, he writes “what do we think of this one? i might try it out unless all this will be in our toolbar ” (emphasis added). Fred’s fund, Union Square Ventures , is an investor in Del.icio.us . The link suggests, therefore, that del.icio.us will be coming out with their own toolbar. Now Since Fred knows that many people monitor his delicious links, it makes you wonder if he’s just messing around, and/or is using this as a way to let the market know that the product is coming. Either way, it’ll be a toolbar worth having and I can’t wait until Joshua releases it. Lots of other rumors of new delicious features coming soon. I’m under super double secret NDA on those.

Since there are limited solutions for organizing physical media using your computer, I like where this is going. Once you’ve registered, you can tell it the books, music, movies and games (physical media) you own. There is also a nice ajax interface to tag items and rate them. Your listal stuff is public – ours is at techcrunch.listal.com . For now, there is no way to make any part of the list private. Features include: I also want to mention a wonderful and similar product called Delicious Monster (Mac-only and not browser-based, you have to download software).  In addition to an award winning design, DM also allows users to simply point a digital video camera at any bar code and capture the media information without typing a single thing in. Delicious Monster launched in November 2004 and racked up sales of $250k in its first month (the product is $40). It is also (or was) headquarted in a Seattle coffee house .

Other than the fact that folding the paper correctly (see screen shot below) is harder than tying a bow tie, there are one or two things I like about it. But I get ahead of myself. For those of you who don’t know, PocketMod is a flash program that allows you to print modules on a piece of paper, so that you can refer to it and take notes on it later.  There are calendars, to do lists, tic-tac-toe, etc. You can up up to eight modules on a page and it folds into a nice little book. I do a lot of actual writing during the day to keep organized. At any given time I have 3-4 pieces of paper in my pocket with notes on product ideas, new companies to profile, etc. So I guess I may start to use this. Especially now that I’ve invested so much time in learning how to fold it properly. There isn’t a whole lot else to say about PocketMod.

Yes, I wrote about new companies (and there are some very interesting ones), but every day brought more heartbreaking news about Hurricane Katrina . By late Thursday night, I was reading one thing on blogs and hearing just the opposite from our federal and state leaders. Like others, I just couldn’t focus on writing about new companies, and I took Friday off from blogging entirely. The weekend has brought better news – record donations from US citizens, aid is flooding in from most of the world, and more people are being rescued. But there is still a very long way to go before things are back to “normal”. And now the political shit-throwing will start in earnest. If you can, consider donating to the red cross or other charity of your choice, and for the bloggers out there, see the red cross banner page where you can put up an image and link for those wishing to donate. I spent the week in Palo Alto. I am moving to the area this month and finding a house to rent took a long time. I did find one, though, in Atherton, and I’ll be moving in on September 12. We’ll be having an open TechCrunch party there sometime in October, and all are welcome (a wiki for the party will come soon and I’ll announce it on the site). I also had some great meetings this week. Keith Teare and I met with Susan Mernit at a wonderful wine garden she recommended in Palo Alto. I’ll be back there often. We also met with Nicholas Chim , the creator of Personal Bee . During our talk, David Hornik walked by and hung out with us for a bit as well. And possibly the most interesting meeting of the week was with Sam Schillace, one of the founders of Writely , an ajax powered online word processor that is getting a ton of buzz. I really think the “Ajax Office” concept is here to stay, and Writely is one of the best early solutions out there. Here’s this week’s summary: Pandora (update), Attensa , Gahbunga , Ojos , Google Purge , Writely , Skype (update) (I’m surprised this functionality hasn’t gotten more buzz), Kiko , Kiko #2 , Free Wikis , Technorati (update), Findory , Iconize Me , Google Bendi , PocketMod Chris Sherman at SEW writes a comprehensive review of RSS search engines : Fred Wilson writes about where his readers come from, and reveals some very interesting data on the relative popularity of Email v. RSS feeds. The bottom line is that only about a third of his readers access his content via RSS. The rest come directly to the site, or read his daily emails. And later: Ajax and other online office type applications are springing up all over the place. Richard MacManus goes to the trouble of finding many of them and writes about them here . To be honest, there aren’t any good full-suite solutions yet. AjaxOffice is just a web page with a stated intention. Writely has an excellent ajax word processor, but needs to build the rest. How long before the big guys jump in here? The 37Signals Rails Wiki provides an alphabetical list of all known projects created with the Ruby on Rails scripting language. Lots of good stuff here. I’m considering it a to-do list. :-) People are demanding new functionality. I have a source that tells me its coming, and soon. Richard MacManus (did I mention I love his blog?) takes a post (and the comments) by Barb Dybwad (another terrific blog) and comes up with a comprehensive list of mobile RSS readers. Good stuff. I also think the Attensa mobile product will be a winner once it’s released since it’s run on the same engine as their other readers…resulting in wonderful post syncronization at last. You can now purchase a swiss army knife with a 1 gb usb drive built in. How cool is that? Pretty cool.",,2005-09-04 00:00:00
,Findory Is Your Personalized Newspaper,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/03/findory-is-your-personalized-newspaper/,"I’ve recently become interested in companies that exploit the actions and attention of users to provide personalized content recommendations. We wrote about Attensa’s efforts in this area earlier this week. Personal Bee is also taking a very creative crack at solving the problem (update on them soon). Findory , which is almost two years old, is a pioneer in this area and has a unique solution. Findory is a personalized newspaper that evolves, quickly, as you click and read. I’ve been trading emails Greg Linden , Findory’s co-founder and CEO, for a few weeks and we finally had a chance to talk at length a couple of days ago. Greg and his co-founder Alex Edelman, spent years at Amazon prior to creating Findory, and gathered extensive experience in recommending new products to Amazon users. Findory works. There is no nead to register, it will know who you are via a cookie. If you do register there are additional benefits to the service. I’ve been using it for a while now and it presents exactly what I want to read (technology) on the home page. They have three silos of information, all personalized – news, blogs and search. Findory looks at your historical clickstream and presents only related information. It evolves real-time as you search, browse, click and read stuff that interests you. Want to add specific feeds that you know you like? Check out their feed page and add them. They also use their personalization algorithm (patent-pending) to present super-relevant google ads on some pages. It’s a simple idea with powerful technology behind it, and can be classified under “it just works”. Read what others have to say here . Check it out. Findory just may become my new home page. And in true web 2.0 fashion, all of this was created by two people – Greg Linden and Alex Edelman",Findory,2005-09-03 00:00:00
,Iconize Me – Online Caricatures For $15,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/03/iconize-me-online-caricatures-for-15/,"Iconize Me will create a hand-drawn caricature of a picture that you supply to them, for $15. See samples here . Iconize Me is the creation of Paul Sahner and Shalimar Luis and is based in New York. The service was launched two years ago, but was re-launched recently. They use Adobe Illustrator to draw and color, Adobe Photoshop so make JPEGs and GIFs, and IconFactory IconBuilder Pro to make the icons. In their FAQs they state that they’ve created over 1,200 icons. No real technology here, but the design is very, very good. The results are fun to view and the price is right. In fact, the price might be too low. The service seems to be in a perpetual backlog – every time I’ve checked they are not taking any additional orders. You can pay an additional fee for high res jpeg and vector pdf files of the caricature. There is a sister service called Vectorize Me that costs a little more – $35 – and creates a full “portrait” based on the picture you supply them. Portraits are delivered as vector files, which are endlessly enlargeable without pixelization and can therefore be blown up to any desired size. JD Lasica blogged about Iconize Me way back in 2003. Dan Costa wrote about them more recently.",,2005-09-03 00:00:00
,We'Re Not Blogging Today,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/02/were-not-blogging-today/,"The Katrina situation is just too horrible. I can’t get passionate about tech when a million people’s homes have been destroyed, there are dead bodies in the streets of New Orleans, our military is pointing their guns at people who just want water, and entire cities have been wiped out.

,Kiko – Ajax + Calendar,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/01/kiko-ajax-calendar/,"Online calendar solutions are launching quite regularly now – see Trumba and Hula for examples. But while Trumba is charging $40 a year, and Hula is an open source project, not an application that we can just use, Kiko seems to be free, simple to use, and ajax based. At least, I can’t find anything on the site referring to a fee. I haven’t been able to test the product because when I try to create a user account a I get an error, and the demo link on the home page doesn’t seem to work. Since they launched only yesterday, perhaps they are getting a bit more traffic than they expected. When it’s working and/or I’ve had a chance to talk to the founders , I’ll write a full review. For now, Kiko promises to work like a “native application” – click, drag, drop, etc., and to put everything you need on a single page dashboard. They also promise future functionality that includes  import/export functionality to iCal and Outlook, and mobile versions. Marc Hedlund also wrote about Kiko. Thanks for Ivan Pope at FeedNation for emailing me about this.",Kiko,2005-09-01 00:00:00
,Kiko – A Screenshot,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/01/kiko-a-screenshot/,"Kiko (see our post below ), an ajax calendar application, is working now and we were able to grab a screenshot.

,Technorati Releases Major New Feature,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/01/technorati-releases-major-new-feature/,"Dave Sifry announced the Technorati Blog Finder this evening. Derek Powazek at Technorati also posts on Blog Finder here . What is it? It’s a ranked list of blogs. By Tag. David Powazek calls it “a mini Top 100 for any topic you can imagine”. Here’s Katrina . Here’s Web 2.0 . Here’s Skype . How good is it? I think it has some problems. Tags are publisher created and so publishers will add a lot of them, and will have an incentive to push the envelope on what is considered an appropriate tag for their blog. I believe, for instance, that I could make TechCrunch a very popular cooking site simply by adding the tag “cooking” to the TechCrunch blog. There are three ways tags are added. Technorati has already tagged “over 2 million blogs” according to Sifry, and that appears to be accurate. The other two way tags are added are via publisher tools (note the text below is tailored to add a “web2.0” tag): Technorati did do a pretty good job of selecting tags that describe Techcrunch, however. There are definitely some changes I’d make, but it’s a good start. The Blog Finder is available as the third tab on Technorati . At first glance, I actually think I prefer the Rojo approach in this case. Rojo’s lists use tags that readers have used to describe individual posts that a blog has published. See our profile update here for details . I do, however, believe that lists, if they are useful, must be subject based. This is an interesting experiment in solving this problem.

,Ojos – Auto Name & Tag Your Photos,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/31/ojos-auto-name-tag-your-photos/,"Ojos hasn’t launched yet, and may even change it’s name. But a bit of buzz has started about them already, stoked by a post by Rob Hof at Businessweek and followed by Ho John Lee . The company’s founders include Burak Gokturk, a Stanford Ph.D. who holds 15 patents in facial recognition (according to Rob Hof) (other team members below), which gives us some idea of what they are up to. The idea behind Ojos is that they will take the photos stored on your hard drive and apply face and text recognition technologies to guess who and what is included in a photo. Tag one photo including a person, and Ojos can automatically tag all other pictures that include that person with the same tags. It sounds simple, but the the technology needed to do this is not. The way I am thinking of this is that Ojos solves the long tail problem with my thousands of unnamed, untagged photos. Sure, I put the occasional picture up on flickr and buzznet and go to the trouble of tagging them, but the vast majority are simply filed away on my hard drive under a general topic and month the picture was taken. This could fix that. One of the co-founders, Munjal Shah, has started a blog and has posted occasionally on Ojos with additional information. Ojos has also hired Tara Hunt , who I’ve been bugging daily for an invite to the alpha (no luck yet). She did send me a very small screen shot of some pictures that have been processed with Ojos – see image to left. I’m pretty sure she gave me permission to post this. :-)  The image includes pictures of Tara over the years, identified and organized by Ojos. It recognized her even through hair color changes. Tara has also posted a few hints about Ojos. If you’d like to get in line for the beta, send an email to “beta at ojos-inc.com”. I’m looking forward to trying this out.

,Google Purge Is On The Way (Humor),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/31/google-purge-is-on-the-way-humor/,"The Onion reports today (yeah, the Onion :-)) that Google will soon be launching “Google Purge”. Google Purge will, apparently, be an effort to destroy all information that Google is otherwise unable to index .  I’m a big fan of the Onion, and they really nailed it this time.

,Writely – Process Words With Your Browser,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/31/writely-process-words-with-your-browser/,"Imagine Word, but as an ajax browser application that was free. And allowed tagging of documents. And you could set reader permissions for each document you create and allow others to edit the document, or just read it. That’s what Writely is. Brian Benzinger at Solution Watch pointed it out to me this evening during a long Google Talk chat.  It is a very functional word processor with most of the bells and whistles you’d expect – a range of fonts and styles, embedded images (up to 2 megs each), spell checker, etc. It has a fantastic wysiwyg editor. It also has an option to upload and/or save in Word format. So the Writely guys and gals built the core feature set with an ajax UI, and then they went a step further and added some cool web 2.0 stuff. In addition to naming a document, you can allow others to edit it, or allow them read-only status. Documents can also be tagged for easy searches later – a nice touch. Writely is also completely free during its beta stage. In many ways, this is a wiki with a nice wysiwyg front end (I keep thinking of wikiwyg ), plus the ability to set permissions. However, it is also more than that Writely is a highly specialized niche application built with ajax. Ajax allows this (and other applications) to act very much like desktop apps. Stuff like this must get Microsoft’s attention…How long will it be before a full suite of platform-independent ajax-enabled office applications becomes available? If all you need is a browser to open and edit these documents, the huge network effect enjoyed by Microsoft Office could simply vanish. For more information on Writely, see their blog here and Shadows in Motion .",,2005-08-31 00:00:00
,Skype Now Has Call Forwarding,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/31/skype-now-has-call-forwarding/,"Skype (previous profile ) released a new beta version – 1.4.0.45 – of their client today. There are a bunch of new features (all are listed below), but there is one that really interesting feature that in my opinion changes the whole VOIP game. Skype now has a true call forwarding feature, allowing you to forward Skype calls to any normal phone, even when you are offline Skype. I hadn’t picked up on this until I read a great Skype blog called Jan in Malaysia a few minutes ago. Call forwarding in an of itself is not new for Skype – Jyve has had a call forwarding feature in their Skype add-on for some time. However, with Jyve, you had to be logged in to Skype for calls to forward. It was a necessary limitation (out of Jyve’s control), but when I’m logged into Skype I don’t need calls forwarded. It’s when I’m logged out and away from my computer that I want this. So when I saw this I got pretty excited. But it is not clear from the Skype download page or their FAQs whether or not you had to be logged in for call forwarding to work. So I tested it. Jan and I each called eachother when we were logged off, and Skype dutifully forwarded the calls to our cell phones. Perfect! Under advanced settings, you can actually set three separate forwarding numbers, and each will ring in the order you set. When you are offline, a special icon appears letting people know they can call you and it will forward to a normal phone. Here are all of the new features:",Skype,2005-08-31 00:00:00
,Rate Your Date On Gahbunga,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/29/189/,"Gahbunga launched today . It was created by the guys at Weblogs Work ( profile ) and is at least as interesting as Consumating , another Texas dating startup (I think these two companies should work together). The idea? It’s “hot or not” for your cell phone. You take a picture of someone (hopefully with their permission). It’s sent to your friends and, if you desire, to the entire Gahabunga community (talk about pressure). They rate the person’s intellect, personality and overall charisma physical hotness. You get the opinions of your friends and the Gahbunga community in moments. Your level of insecurity determines your next move, I guess. See the site: Yes, people will be offended. But this is an interesting experiment. Right? I dunno. It’s late and I’m going to bed. Can’t wait to see the comments on this one.",,2005-08-29 00:00:00
,Collaborative Writing – Unblokt,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/28/collaborative-writing-unblokt/,"Sometimes blog (and any other) writing day after day is hard. The creative juices stop flowing. You have something interesting to talk about, but the words just don’t flow . Tris Hussey reads (real books) to blog better. Others take the weekend off (I don’t remember where I read this). I just sit in front of my computer and listen to Pandora until I start rocking again (no, I don’t work for Pandora but I am in love with them). :-) Today I read a post by Jon Aquino (a favorite blog of mine)  saw something that may also also help – unblokt . It’s also just really, really fun. Unblokt is a collaborative writing experiment created by Sean O’Hagan that anyone can participate it.

,Web 2.0 This Week (August 21-27),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/28/web-20-this-week/,"I spent most of this week in Palo Alto working on Archimedes Ventures projects. I was able to post about most of the companies I met at Bar Camp (with one notable exception, which is to come). Lots of interesting Web 2.0 news to report from the week as well. Richard MacManus continues to lead the small but growing group of blogs defining Web 2.0 thinking. Our respective weekly summaries are very different and rarely overlap. Reading his blog is necessary to getting an overall picture of what’s going on. I read every word he writes, and it is time well spent (I actually also subscribe to his delicious links). There are a few other blogs that I have recently added to my reader and that I highly recommend. The Mobile Technology Weblog , written by Oliver Starr, is an extremely popular blog that touches on many new technologies affecting the Web 2.0 space. Check it out. I also recommend Horse Pig Cow , written by Tara Hunt (who recently moved to San Francisco to work at a new Web 2.0 company called Ojos ) and Amber Mac , a blog written by Amber MacArthur in Toronto. If anyone is interested in getting my entire opml file for my RSS reader, just send me a note and I’ll send you the link. Here’s this week’s summary: The Personal Bee , Measure Map , Hula , Google Talk , TooDou , Kahuna (update), Pandora (update), Flock , The Big Moo , Raw Sugar , WeblogsWork , unblokt “Charlie”, an analyst for Union Square Ventures (Fred Wilson’s firm), wrote a post with the above title, giving good advice on starting a successful Web 2.0 company. Advice includes such wisdoms as ” Launch.  Now.  Tomorrow.  Every day.”, “” Solve the smallest possible problem”,  and “Get a responsive and chatty audience using the product.” Good stuff. For those of you new to the idea of microformats, I recommend reading Adam’s essay on the subject . He lists some of the more popular efforts in the area, and also opines on the value of disaggregating “content” from applications. Brad Feld has been posting on aspects of venture capital term sheets for the last few months. He completed the series last week and linked to previous posts on the subject. It’s a total of 20 posts and in my opinion, they should pdf it and sell it. Bookmark this link for future use. Jeff Clavier gave one of the better presentations at Bar Camp last weekend. Sound advice on the venture capital process from someone who’s been in the business for years. See his post here and download his presentation here . If you are a young Web 2.0 company who needs solid advice, try to work with Jeff. He only works with 4-5 companies at a time, and they tend to be winners. If you are interested in China ( we are ), you’ll want to read this Business Week interview with Hu Zhiguang (See Stephen Baker as well). He is the founder of Blogcn , one of the leading blog service providers in China. Chilling stuff: Two of my favorite  bloggers joined Paul Scrivens’ 9Rules Network last week. Looks like 9Rules is aggresively expanding beyond their core topic of web design. A complete list of their current blogs is at the bottom of this page. Congratulations to Richard and Brian. Jupiter Research published a report detailing the average consumer of blogs. See eweek , Steve Rubel and MarketingLoop for summaries of the report. In general, those of us into blogs and related stuff are male, rich and young. Since rich and young are subjective, I can safely say that I am at least one of the three. From Steve (summarizing from eweek): Duncan Riley at Blog Herald writes a loooong post titled “ The demise of the geek bloggers “. Robert Scoble and Steve Rubel pitch in their thoughts as well.

,Group Search With Raw Sugar,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/27/group-search-with-raw-sugar/,"Raw Sugar is somewhat similar to Rollyo , which we profiled yesterday. Raw Sugar basically combines del.icio.us type social bookmarking, with search (of your and other’s bookmarks, along with google results). You can save a URI found in Raw Sugar Search results, or use a bookmarklet to save any browsed page (support at this time for firefox and explorer only). You can also add a description and tags. Your tags are saved on your user page with a unique URI. This page is also customizable with images, pictures, etc. For instance, taking someone at random, here is Frank , who is apparently just about to complete a world class bellyflop and likes, among other things, kung fu (if his tags are indicative of his interests). He also likes the Ramones, which is one of my favorite bands (reminds me that I need to create a Ramones station on Pandora ). Raw Sugar offers a nice search service that leverages tagged pages and presents them in search results  (keyword and tagged based results look to be mixed, which seems right). They also have a “refine” option after your first search, which further narrows the results set (something Technorati really needs to add). Given that Del.icio.us recently added search , Raw Sugar may have a long hill to climb. Overall, it’s a useful service that could use a little jazzing (and ajaxing) up of its user interface.

I’m finding that I spend more and more time talking with these guys about new ideas, and we are linking to eachother so often that people are starting to talk. :-) Weblogs Work designs, builds and promotes new applications, and will also assist third parties in application building if there is a fit. Existing and future applications include things like eflURL (our profile ), Gahbunga , Frankenfeed, EgorRSS, and EgorOPML. Many or all of these will be profiled on TechCrunch in the near future. Brian Oberkirch (who has a really excellent personal blog called Like It Matters ) is the CEO. He is a former literature professor, college baseball player, and marketing executive, turned entrepreneur.  The company is 50% marketing/PR guys like Brian and 50% tech/coder guys like Scott Ryan (26 total employees/contractors).

,Flock – Social Browsing Is Cool,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/26/flock-social-browsing-is-cool/,"Flock is a new browser, built on top of firefox. It is a functional browser with excellent features (including firefox features like tabbed browsing, etc.). What really makes is stand out are two additional features they’ve added to build social networking directly into the browsing experience: social bookmarking and a wysiwyg blog writing tool. Flock was originally called Round Two and raised money (reportedly around $1 million) from Bessemer Venture Partners. For more on the fundraising and early reports, see Om Malik and SiliconBeat . We got our first look at Flock at Bar Camp last weekend – Andy Smith and Chris Messina gave a great demo. Our beta invitation came that weekend as well. Flock should be launching publicly sometime in September. They have windows, mac and linux versions of their browser already. Flock has integrated del.icio.us-type features right into the browser. When you are on a page you would like to bookmark, simply press a “+” button on the top left of the toolbar and the page is automatically included in your bookmark area (called your “breadcrumbs”). You can also tag bookmarks, of course. Additional features include your “watchlist” (people who’s bookmarks you would like to monitor), and “groups” (basically, defined groups of flockers linking to this category). Breadcrumbs, Watchlists and Groups all have RSS feeds (of course). This is pure magic. We’ve tested most blogging tools out there, including qumana (the best in our opinion – profiled here and here ), blogjet ( Jeff Clavier likes this one ) and others. All of these requre a download and allow offline drafting and wysiwyg functionality. I have to say I think Flock blows them all away. I’m dying to show a screen shot, but Flock has asked it’s beta testers not to (so ignore the very, very small screen shot above). To show this right now would be pushing the limits of their trust, so I won’t. But it rocks. Setup was very easy (I tested it with my personal blog). It has functionality for editing posts (even posts not created with Flock), quick toggle between preview and viewing the actual code, and, the best feature in my opinion, the ability to simply drag flickr photos direclty into the post and manipulate them. They also allow quick and easy technorati tagging. Wow. I mean, really, wow. This stuff is not trivial to build. The ajax funtionality is stunning. Bart Decrem is Flock’s CEO and co-founder.

,The Big Moo By Seth Godin,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/26/the-big-moo-by-seth-godin/,"Seth Godin is my favorite business writer right now. In fact, as I look around, my desk is littered with copies of his books – Purple Cow (my favorite), All Marketers are Liars , and Unleashing the Ideavirus . Read these books and learn about how to build and market products that will excite your customers. See here for a short interview with Seth by Brian Oberkirch. I haven’t had the opportunity to meet Seth in person yet, but I sure hope to. I’ll probably act like a teenage girl meeting some cool pop band, and not know what to say. Maybe I’ll get a picture with him. That would be cool. His books are crisply written and to the point. And his points are good. One of my favorite quotes, from Purple Cow, is: As I mentioned in a recent weekly summary (see no. 6), Seth’s new book, The Big Moo , is coming out and he’s eating his own dogfood in promoting it. Seth has started selling batches of 50 galley copies to people if they promise to “sneeze” the book to other influential people. I purchased 50 copies, and am now offering them to TechCrunch readers. By the way, the book is another winner. It’s a collaborative effort – Seth has brought in 33 “of the world’s smartest business thinkers” to write the book. I started it last night and have almost finished it. I am learning to not be boring. I am trying to be fearless. I am going to risk it all (more on this later…edgeio). I am giving these books away. The first 10 comments to this post get a free copy. I’ll even pay the shipping if you are in the US or Canada. If you are somewhere else, I’ll ask for $5 in shipping. Dave Wheeler did the same thing and got an overwhelming response. I’ll send another batch to the first 10 people who post about the book and trackback here. Same rules apply on shipping. If you comment, I already have your email address. If you trackback, make sure you send you email me at editor@techcrunch.com along with the post URL. Once I have the 20 complete, I’ll send out a mass email to get your shipping address. Good luck to those of you who use slow RSS readers. :-)",,2005-08-26 00:00:00
,Rollyo – Roll Your Own Search Engine,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/26/rollyo-roll-your-own-search-engine/,"Note: Due to a misunderstanding, I posted a profile of Rollyo while the company was in private beta and did not want any publicity (the misunderstanding was that I didn’t know this when I posted). They have requested that I remove the post for now, and I am complying. Nothing heavy, I just received a very polite email request from a very smart employee of the company. In my opinion, all this controversy just adds more buzz and is ultimately good for the company.

,"Kahuna (Hotmail Beta) – Extreme Marketing, New Teasers",https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/24/additional-teasers-for-kahuna-hotmail-beta/,"I am a little bit annoyed right now. Sometimes people get a little too cute. Microsoft’s Kahuna may be falling into that category. I’m pretty excited about Kahuna because I love ajax and this is going to be one cool ajax application. It looks like (and should be) the new version of Hotmail will act very much like a desktop application. I like that. I want to try it out, and blog about it. And although I don’t always get an invitation to participate in a beta, I usually don’t have to waste a lot of time getting to an answer. Kahuna is offering beta invites, but require you to read through team member blogs to find out the answers to questions. If you find the answer, you get another hint. Here’s a recent post by Imran Qureshi , the Kahuna Program Manager: WTF? This is stupid. This is not time well spent. This does nothing to build a brand or make me a loyal user. It suceeds only in pissing me off. I’d much rather use this time either testing Kahuna (and most likely writing amazing things about it), or testing something else (there are lots of other profiles on my to-do list). So, do you guys agree and consider it kind of lame to waste our time like this? Or am I wrong and this treasure hunt is an example of hip, cool, edgey and/or extreme marketing (marketing 2.0)? I am now done with this particular gripe. Back to Kahuna, Imran has posted additional screen shots and information on the service. He had a previous post where he stated 2 of his top 5 reasons for liking Kahuna. Today he posted reasons 3 and 4 (leaving us in suspense for #5), along with a new screen shot of Kahuna (see to left): It really does look like Kahuna will be user friendly and fast.

,Hula – (Possibly) A New Ajax Calendar,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/23/hula-possibly-a-new-ajax-calendar/,"We just heard about a new online calendar application called Hula that’s ajax-based. It hasn’t launched and we can’t find the website for it, but  some  bloggers are linking to a couple of flash movies that show it in action. This reminds us of Apple’s iCal. The power of Ajax to make web apps work like desktop apps is awesome. I just hope it’s cheaper than Trumba , which is charging $40/year. Update: Thanks to Ross in the comments area, we now have a link to Hula . “Hula is a calendar and mail server whose goal is to be fun and easy to use, while scaling effortlessly from small groups to large organizations with thousands of members. Hula is an open source project led by Novell .”",,2005-08-23 00:00:00
,"Google Talk Live, Functional",https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/23/google-talk-live-functional/,"There’s been blog chatter all day about Google Talk . I didn’t write about it because I couldn’t use it (it hadn’t launched yet) and I certainly wasn’t “breaking” the story. Not only that,  it seems to me that Skype already has a quite nice and functional application to do this type of thing. And the fact that Google Talk had a wikipedia page up even before it launched made me sort of think things had gotten a little out of hand. But I couldn’t resist, of course. The second the client was available for download I jumped to the site and took the plunge. Google Talk works and it looks and sounds cool. It’s now the 15th IM client on my desktop – MSN, meetro, Yahoo, Skype, Gizmo, AIM, … You don’t have to download Google’s software to use the service. You can use any Jabber/XMPP client . Cnet puts it well: Google Talk has a nice interface, works quickly and is generally a great product. Here’s the key features: Here’s what it lacks: So try it out and feel free to add us (techcrunch is our username). Keith Teare, my partner at Archimedes Ventures, is thinking that Google is very obviously dripping out features and products that Microsoft is including in Vista.

I met so many interesting people at Bar Camp and added their blogs to my Pluck reader. I am now reading over 320 blogs and loving the Internet more than ever. I’m tired, but full of energy!

Robert Scoble met with Plaxo last week and wrote a post about it. I was in a cranky mood that day and got into it with Plaxo employees in the comments section . I regret writing those comments, and I plan on profiling the positive aspects of the service sometime this week.

,The Personal Bee – A Better Way To Read News,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/22/the-personal-bee-a-better-way-to-read-news/,"There’s something I’ve been griping about for a long time (most recently to Adam Marsh on the first evening of Bar Camp ): I read hundreds of feeds every day (320 as of today), and it takes frickin forever to go through it all. There is a better way to find good content in a massive number of posts from hundreds of feeds than clicking on each feed and screening it yourself. And I know what it is. My idea? Automate the process, and return the results visually. A Tag Cloud is a perfect way to do this. Imagine if all of your unread feeds were scanned, keywords and/or tags were analyzed, and a tag cloud was created where you could see words with font size and boldness determined by how prominent they were in the posts. That way, you could just click on what you want to read, and ignore the fluff. This appears to be what The Personal Bee (note: this site is down quite often)  is experimenting with. Created by Nicholas Chim as a side project from his day job, Personal Bee has this to say about itself: Adam Marsh tells me that Nicholas presented at Bar Camp, although I was not present at the session (thanks for passing this on Adam). I wish I was there. Personal Bee has a number of public feeds (see Web 2.0 for instance), and you can also register and create your own private or public feeds. As you can see from the screenshot, a tag cloud is placed prominently in the left sidebar. Things like “Feedster 500” and “Pandora” are big – things I want to click on right away. When I do click on a word in the tag cloud, the relevant content is pulled. Bloglines, Pluck, Rojo, Attensa, NewsGator, and others: Please note this application, and listen to your power users. There is a better way to show new data, and it is so easy to implement. I’ll be playing around with this application a lot in the near future.",,2005-08-22 00:00:00

The site is taking registration requests now. People who are participating in the alpha are drooling. It’s apparently a blog analytics tool that crushes everything else out there.

,Dave Winer'S Purple Cow – The Opml Editor,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/21/dave-winers-creates-a-purple-cow-opml-editor/,"Dave Winer has been working on outlining software for over 20 years. Check out his OPML Editor (OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language) that has recently come out of private beta – people are using it for everything from writing and updating simple to-do lists to creating and editing blogs. It’s extremely versatile and it’s open source. Since people are writing exhaustively about the product and the technology (and using it for incredibly creative things ), I want to talk about it from a different angle. For those of you familiar with Seth Godin , you’ll know what a Purple Cow is. The basic idea of the purple cow is that for products to be noticed in today’s world of fragmented attention and product saturation, it has to be something really special. You don’t notice cows any more no matter how cool they are (because they are basically all the same), but you sure would notice a big purple cow munching on some grass in a field somewhere. Dave has in my opinion masterfully crafted a purple cow with his OPML Editor. I’ve been witnessing its development and launch for a while now, and I’m impressed. The first time I saw the software in action was earlier this year in New York (Dave gave me a demo). The second time I saw it was just before the Gnomedex conference this year in Seattle.  That’s about the time that Dave put his marketing efforts into high gear. After the sofware was (mostly) baked, Dave invited a small group of trusted friends to bang on it. Because this was such a select group, the people involved really felt special (and they were). They went out of their way to provide good feedback. He took their input and made changes. Then he increased the size of the group to 20 or so (I was in this group). At Gnomedex, he increased the size further. All the while, Dave was getting free QA and product work, and these people were blogging about how awesome and powerful it was. Lots of people read the blogs of the testers, and want to know more. Heck, I begged him to be on the invite list. On June 23, 2005, Dave announced that he would start using the OPML editor to edit Scripting News, his blog: Even more people learn about the software and understand that it can be used for things like writing and editing blogs, and want to know more. Dave, who travels quite a bit anyway, started to hold OPML Editor road shows around the country. I believe the first one was in New York on July 12 , and he’s been in many cities since. Tonight, he had a road show in Berkeley , and 100+ people packed into the audience to see the Editor in action. I was there, and people were interested, inquisitive and downright passionate about it. More users check it out. It’s available now, so people are starting to use it for unexpected things, and it grows virally. Dave is not a professional marketer, but he’s one of the best marketers I’ve seen. He’s spent exactly nothing in marketing dollars to promote the product (unless you count gas money),  and yet he’s created a whole group of influential users (mostly bloggers who sneeze about the product) who feel special because they were part of the closed testing group. Not to mention hundreds more who’ve attended his road shows because Dave made the effort to come to them, show them the product and patiently answer the same questions over and over in different cities. And yes, Dave is also eating his own dog food by using his product to write one of the most popular blogs on the internet ( #22 tonight out of 14 million or so total blogs). I’m impressed.",OPML_Editor,2005-08-21 00:00:00
,Event – Bar Camp (Day 2),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/21/event-bar-camp-day-2/,"Day 2 of Bar Camp was, if possible, more interesting than Day 1 (perhaps becasue Day 1 was only 5 hours, while Day 2 was a full 24 hours). I had to slip out in the late afternoon to go to the OPML Editor road show in Berkeley, but saunterd back in late evening just as the drinking binge was getting into full swing. But the drinking and partying was justified. It was a long and productive day. Notes below. Once again, I need to point out that I saw only a small fraction of the total stuff that was going on. Andy Smith  flickrs  it . It’s also the most popular tag on Flickr right now. The most exciting presentation of the day was Pandora . I wasn’t there for it, of course, but Tom  Conrad, Padora’s CTO, gave me a private demo earlier in the day and I profiled it here . Make sure you check this one out. Robert Scoble likes it too and has additional company information. Flock (“Social browser based on the Mozilla engine to give you the tools to talk back to the web”)  gave an excellent presentation showing off their brand new stuff. I have a beta invite and will be profiling Flock this week. I met some incredibly interesting people yesterday, including Kevin Burton , Robert Scoble , and Eris Stassi (who created the Bar Camp logo). I was also able to spend time hanging out with Sam Perry, who I first met at Always On and who is becoming a good friend. Had a late night dinner with Steve Gillmor, Dave Winer, Niall Kennedy, Robert Scoble and Buzz Bruggeman as well. I didn’t realize I broke the WikyWyg news in my Day 1 notes . This was blogged on by Jeff Jarvis later as well yesterday, and Ross Mayfied announced it on his blog . This is going to be talked about a lot in the coming weeks. Do I look like I can fit into a medium tshirt? For the love of God, people, get your act together and order some more XL tshirts!  On a related note, do you really think you can leave boxes of KitKats and other junk food around and I won’t eat 10 of them? That’s irresponsible. :-) Heading back now for more presentations and junk food. By the way, our Day 1 Notes on Bar Camp was by far our most clicked on post ever.",,2005-08-21 00:00:00
,Google Sidebar To Launch Monday,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/21/google-sidebar-to-launch-monday/,"UPDATE: I just saw this link to Sidebar at Google’s site . Thanks Fred !

,Profile – Skylook (For Skype),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/20/profile-skylook-for-skype/,"Outlook is cool. Skype is cool. Get a couple of Australians to bang them together and what do you get? Skylook . It skypefies Outlook and it’s awesome. Skype does already have a product for Outlook, which we profiled last month . Skylook is much more advanced and easy to use (although, unlike Skype’s Outlook Toolbar, it is not free). The download is about 2.2 mb. You can try it out for free with a 14 day trial. $29.95 after that to purchase. After installation, there are three main feature areas that I like. The first feature I like is auto-recording of all skype calls and IM chats. After recording, Skylook places the file in a special folder and they can be forwarded via email, searched, etc. The second feature I like is that you have presence information for skype contacts directly within Outlook, and you can start IMs and voice calls directly from Outlook. The third feature I like is the ability to “one click” call contacts via either skype or skype out, directly from their vcard. Skylook’s CEO, Jeremy Hague, wrote to me and included the following information: Skylook is a keeper for us. And not just because Jeremy gave me a free activation key. :-) I’d pay for this.

,Dig Into The Music Long Tail – Pandora,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/20/dig-into-the-music-long-tail-pandora/,"Company:  Pandora (formerly Savage Beast Technologies) Launched:  July 21 (private alpha) Public Beta: Within two weeks Employees: 50 (including 30 musicians) Location: Oakland, CA Do you love music? Are you the kind of person who’s pissed off because your iPod only holds 60 gigs? If you are, stop reading this, click over to Pandora and request an invitation to their private alpha right now . Then come back and read the rest of this post. If you don’t agree that this is the coolest application you’ve seen in a long while, re-read this post over and over until you agree, because you are wrong. I am in love with Pandora. It’s like the Internet was invented so that Pandora could be. I met with Tom Conrad , Pandora’s CTO, today at Bar Camp and he gave me a private demonstration. He’s presenting to the group today at 5 pm as well. What is it? It is a music recommendation engine and player and it is the future of discovering the long tail of music. Pandora is a technology based solution. They spend about 20 minutes analyzing the identity of a song (“everything from melody, harmony and rhythm, to instrumentation, orchestration, arrangement, lyrics, and of course the rich world of singing and vocal harmony”) – and they’ve analyzed 300,000 of them (10,000 artists) over the last five years. See Pandora’s Music Genome Project – a five year project involved scores of musicians to analyze music: And…it works! Once you’ve registered, you simply create a “channel” by typing in an artist or song name. It may ask for clarification if it has multiple matches, then it will start streaming the song (or one of the artist’s songs if you’ve chosen an artist) at 128k (great quality). Here’s the good part. Click on a button and you can find similar music by other artists. I created a Nirvana category. Soon Pandora was playing “The Man Who Sold the World” (a great song”). By clicking forward, Pandora then played “Wings of the Throne” by Guided by Places, “How’s it Going to Be” by Third Eye Blind, and then “Nutshell” by Alice in Chains. Perfect. Click on any song and buy it on iTunes or Amazon. Here’s a secret way to get an instant invite into Pandora (I think you deserve it for reading this deep into the post). Pandora allows you to share your channels (and even has a most popular list). Click on my Nirvana Channel and you will be prompted to sign up, bypassing the invitation requirement . Correction. If you would like an invitation to Pandora, please email me at editor@techcrunch.com and I will send one to you. I have 25  12  3 none left (where were these people when I was looking for a little love on consumating :-)  ). Update:  If you email me, I can still get invites from Pandora, but it will take a few hours to turn it around. I can’t deal with the volume. I’m done with invites. You’re on your own. One last tidbit that Tom shared with me – Apparently, sometimes people like certain kinds of music that they think is pretty darn fringe/indie/hard core. And sometimes, when they look at related music after Pandora has put it through an objective technical analysis, they see stuff by britney spears/hilary duff/[insertcraphere]. Pandora isn’t broken. The listener is. :-) I am going to be posting a ton more on this over time. 10 hours free for every new user $3 per month after that Update:  Scoble loves this too :",Pandora,2005-08-20 00:00:00
,Update – Rojo (New Stuff),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/19/update-rojo-new-stuff/,"Rojo launched two new features this week: expanded tag functionality and top 100 feeds. Rojo now lists the top 100 feeds subscribed to by users. The top ten include the usual suspects, which at least shows that Rojo users are pretty mainstream v. other readers. They call it the Rojo 100 . You can also view the most read feeds for any given tag. This second part is more interesting. The top 100 is just another list – not super interesting as a stand alone feature. However, the ability to type a tag and see the most popular feeds based on the tag is, actually, quite useful. In particular, we like the results for the tag “ Web2.0 “, which lists Read/Write Web and TechCrunch in the top two spots (looks perfect to us!). Rojo is one of the only feed readers to allows tagging of feeds and posts. They are starting to release tools to help users find new content based on other users’ tags. Check out popular feeds based on the tags you select: See the Rojo Blog for more information.",Rojo,2005-08-19 00:00:00
,Event – Bar Camp (Day 1),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/19/event-bar-camp-day-1/,"Today I drove over 300 miles (Los Angeles to Palo Alto) to get to Bar Camp . I believe that was the farthest distance anyone traveled, although I haven’t fact-checked that yet. In fact, I haven’t fact checked anything below, so if there are errors please email me or leave a comment and I’ll fix it. It was worth the drive. The event started at 7:00. Everyone had to “sign in” and “take a picture” which consisted of writing your name in a marker pen on a long scrolling paper and drawing your own avatar. People loved it – and there were a lot of people (minus a few stragglers who never made it out of the cafe :-)). There was a working “wiki” literally written up on a whiteboard (real wiki here) and people were free to add discussion topics to the agenda for either of the two meeting rooms. Pizza was delivered. There was a referigerator full of beer (less full later in the evening). And there was wide open wifi. Paradise. My notes for the day are below. This is by no means a transcript of what happened (there was just too much). But it is my views and opinions on the stuff I was able to participate in. After introductions (led by Andy Smith and Chris Messina from Flock), Ross Mayfield led a discussion about how to (quickly, easily, informally) create a communication and feedback mechanism for attendees (including those not physically present). Lots of good ideas, mostly centered around the wiki since it’s up and running. By the way, if you haven’t read it yet, check out Chris’ post on how Bar Camp was created . Ross also spoke about a new product that Social Text has soft-launched, called WikiWyg . It deserves its own profile (and will get one if I can corner Ross long enough to talk about it a bit more), but it is basically a tool to allow people to edit wiki’s without using wiki code. Try out the demo – you can double click on any text on the page and toggle between a wysiwyg editor, a wikitext editor, and preview. If they add authorization functionality, this would be one great way to edit your own blog, as well. Mike Prince, the founder of Mobido , gave a brief demo of his company. There wasn’t enough time for me to fully understand Mobido, but it is a network for sharing photos and short content (names, contact info, etc.) around an event. One use of this is for everyone at an event to take a picture of themselves and post in on a Mobido event page, along with their name, etc., and people can see everyone who attended and know who they are. There are RSS capabilities as well. This is another company I’d like to profile. I walked in to this session a bit late. The official title was “blogging for Profit” and was led by Niall Kennedy (Technorati). The discussion evolved into a general discussion of “what is blogging”  and “why do people blog” over time. Jeff Clavier made an interesting comment in response to a question. Jeff, who is a VC, said he blogs because it helps him network with companies and gives him leads. I agree that few VCs are blogging, and most that do blog mostly about being a VC ( with  notable  exceptions of course). You can tell from Jeff’s blog that he is more than open to getting communications from new companies, and it has served him very, very well. I also think blogging, if you do it intensely, gives you excellent insight into developing trends way before everyone else sees them. You get this partly from reading blogs, and partly from comments and email from people talking about what they are doing. Interaction, lead generation and early intelligence is (mostly) why I love writing for TechCrunch so much. As a related aside, I hear that a company I profiled a month ago may be getting some more mainstream press in the near future. :-) The session ended with Dorrian Porter (click…subscribed to feed) suggesting that the group consider attempting to categorize blogs by intent or subject matter. A big task in my opinion. Jacob Appelbaum gave a presentation of his “motorcycle” project – a sniffer of content on wifi networks. He proved the power of his application by reading out random passwords of people in the audience (who where blogging, checking email, etc., while listening). The occasional “Crap! that’s mine” and “please shut this off” was heard. I simply shut down my computer. He talked about how easy it is to “own someone” by monitoring their traffic. Because people tend to recycle passwords, he said, once you have one password you likely have access to their entire life. Scary stuff. Jacob also noted that many new web 2.0 companies, like flickr, are not hashing passwords as they are sent over the net, meaning they can easily be sniffed by anyone monitoring the local network. He’s launching motorcyle as an open source project “for people to use and enjoy.” By the way, Jiwire has a product called Spotlock that will encrypt your traffic and help you avoid this type of thing. $5 a month, free to try. I’ll be installing it before tomorrow morning. I met a number of interesting people tonight and subscribed to their blogs. I’m sure there will be lots more over the weekend.

,Profile – Vitalsource,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/17/profile-vitalsource/,"Every once in a while I am surprised by some of the new web-application ideas people come up with. Some are bad – in fact, it’s disappointing to see so many applications launched just for the sake of launching -, but sometimes (just sometimes) you can actually feel when a project is set to solve a problem, even if for a small group of people. VitalSource was announced yesterday, and I must admit I’ve been thinking about what its impact might be. Since you’re probably wondering by now, VitalSource is a web-application with the iTunes-twist. It consists of a client-side application (currently available for your Mac or Windows machine) that allows you to “buy books as you buy your music”. A quote from their press release explains it best: VitalSource sure sounds promising. This wouldn’t be an article by me if it didn’t have an ammount of constructive criticism and question asking, though. There’s a few issues that come to my mind about this application: 1) If they are targetting students, why not support an operating system that students seem to be using more and more? You know, Linux. I can imagine some people climbing up their chairs screaming “market share! market share!”, but this is a matter of accomodating a lot of people from one of the major target markets – students (and very importantly I imagine, IT students). 2) I’m always sceptical when I see a new proprietary format for any kind of information, particularly now that the web is all about reusing content and taking advantage of open formats. Naturally, VitalBook is proprietary because (and I’m assuming here, people) of piracy issues, and in order to provide DRM . But that raises some questions about the use of a Book bought in VS outside of VS itself. Will it have a use? Will it be possible to read? People are starting to read on their computers, I agree, but is the market share worth it? Despite these two questions – that are no more than eye-openers – I believe VitalSource does solve a problem for some people, particularly people who either can’t afford hardcopy books, or won’t need to keep a book all the time for reference. The idea of buying books at the kind of prices they’re announcing is, undoubtedly, exciting. There’s huge competition in this field, though ( Amazon and O’Reillys Safari Bookshelf ), and it sure will be interesting to see how the market accomodates this new solution. More information about VitalSource is available on their page.",VitalSource,2005-08-17 00:00:00
,Profile – Goowy,https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/17/profile-goowy/,"Goowy has rebuilt a number of commonly used applicatons (like email) in Flash. It includes traditional web services such as email, contacts, calendar, games and widgets. Goowy is highly interactive and, as you’d expect with a flash application – fast. Visually it is a very beautiful site as well, and I wasted a good amount of time today playing around with the applications (including some very addictive games). Goowy is one of the first full featured internet applications that uses Flash 8. For more detail, see Mike Schleifstein ‘s post on Goowy, although I disagree with some of the conclusions in this post – Ajax, xforms and other technologies are gunning for some of these same applications right now. Flash-heavy sites are, however, currently quite trendy, and Goowy seems to be one of the best implementations. While flash can be heavy work for some simple stuff, Macromedia’s current efforts with Flex (as Mark Birbeck tells me) will make Flash a lot easier by using a high-level language on the server. Once you’ve registered for the service, a virtual desktop appears that allows you to access the various applications. The email application is excellent. You are assigned a goowy address (ours is techcrunch@goowy.com), and it also allows users to POP into Goowy from other accounts. Alex Bard, Goowy’s CEO, tells me that they are expanding email capabilities in the near future. Alex also tells me that Macromedia has been very supportive of Goowy, which explains how they have grown to 30,000 users with virtually no marketing: Alex also wrote to me about upcoming features: Goowy’s business model includes advertising and, later, premium subscription pricing and licensing of the platform. They have 8 employees.

,Update – Technorati (Multiple Tag Search),https://techcrunch.com/2005/08/17/update-technorati-multiple-tag-search/,"Niall Kennedy just announced that Technorati now allows multiple tag search . With this new functionality, you can do a single search and find posts that have any of the two or more tags you type in. Niall says: Ok, cool. This saves a bit of time on certain searches. Want to really wow us ? Create “AND” functionality and allow us to filter by multiple keywords. That will get us to super-relevant results, fast.

,Feedburner Releases Important Stats,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/21/feedburner-releases-important-stats/,"Feedburner released important statistics on their service yesterday. If you are unfamiliar with Feedburner, check out our original profile . The graphs show total feeds managed by feedburner and total subscribers to those feeds. Both show hockey-stick like growth that looks similar to data released by Technorati (see item no. 2 in a past TechCrunch weekly summary ). I believe that these stats are very relevant to the blogospere in general. We are in a steadily increasing tide, that is increasing at an increasing rate. All boats are rising. Feedburner now manages about 100,000 feeds and about 4.3 million people subscribe to those feeds. The growth rates are obvious: Paul Kedrosky notes that the number of feed subscribers is doubling approximately every 60 days. What I’d like to know is what percentage pay the $5 per month for the Pro product. If it’s around 5% (that’s my guess), then FeedBurner revenues (not including advertising) would be about $300,000 or so annualized. The only thing left to ask is, do you have your FeedBurner sticker yet ? I do. We’ve previously written about Feedburner on September 7, 2005 , July 15, 2005 , July 4, 2005 and June 14, 2005 .",FeedBurner,2005-09-21 00:00:00
,Goowy Adds Calendar And Other Features,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/30/goowy-adds-calendar-and-other-features/,"Goowy is a browser based desktop tool built on Flash. See our August 17, 2005 profile of Goowy for additional information. Until recently, Goowy’s main draw (other than it is extremely fast)  was a very nice email application. Goowy also allows access of your regular email account in the Goowy UI via pop. Goowy has launched new applications on their flash platform. The two key new beta products are a calendar and a basic RSS reader.  The calendar application is tightly connected to email, and the feature base is as good as most ajax calendars we’ve reviewed. With these additions the suite of products is now becoming much more useful. In the near future Goowy will also be creating a virtual file storage product and allowing email pop into and out of Goowy. Virtual file storage will have an optional desktop application allowing for simple drag and drop access of files into Goowy. They’ve also made the strategic decision to open their API to developers for the creation of new desktop widgets. Pop email access (in and out), email and file storage beyond 100 mb to the 2 gb range and other Goowy premium products will be priced at around $20 per year. The core products will remain free",Goowy,2005-09-30 00:00:00

,Top Five Web 2.0 Venture Capitalists,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/19/top-five-web-20-venture-capitalists/,"Most venture capitalists don’t understand tagging, blogs, rss, ajax, or the two way web. They scoff at social bookmarking sites and think podcasting is a fad (maybe it is). They desparately “want in” to this renaissance of the web, but can’t be bothered to open up the simplest RSS reader and understand the power of decentralized content. In short, they don’t get it. Most traditional VC funds have a single web-focused partner, who may or may not be interested in web 2.0 consumer companies. For the most part, these VCs are not part of the most interesting deals. If they do get what you are pitching, they want to pump way more money into the company than makes sense. Here’s my attempt to point out the venture capitalists who do get it . Some of these have new funds and only recently became venture capitalists. Some of them have been around forever. There are just two personality traits all share. First, they understand that a fundamental shift has occured in web evolution. Second, they are hungry as hell to find deals, and spend more time proactively looking for the next opportunity than they do sitting back and looking at the business plan stream that naturally flows into any venture fund. This list is purely subjective. It’s blatantly biased. Some VCs don’t belong and many who do are left off. But it’s a list, nonetheless, that I’ve come up with over the last few weeks of interviewing entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and journalists. David Cowan is a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and writes a blog called Who Has Time For This . He’s on this list partially because he incubated the hottest and most anticipated company on the web right now, Flock. This guy picks winners. Of 43 early stage investments, 19 have gone public and 16 have been acquired. It could be because of his education – he has the killer combination of a math/CS degree and a MBA from Harvard. Tim Draper invested in Skype. Done. He also sits on the board of SocialText, and his fund was in Baidu. Tim will go anywhere in the world for the right deal. Most VC’s with 1/10th his net worth won’t leave silicon valley for a board meeting. David Hornik is is a General Partner at August Capital and writes a blog that has over 10,000 RSS readers. David best asset is that he knows everybody . He’s the kind of guy you want to drink beers with while watching a football game.  If you are his friend, he’ll happily introduce you to anyone, and often puts two people together just because he thinks they should know each other. He’s invested in companies that are defining the web today: SixApart and Technorati among them. And even if he doesn’t invest, he’ll do more than most VCs who have invested to help you. Here’s just one example – take a look at the things he says about Pandora , which isn’t a portfolio company. David has told me on numerous occasions that “the web is an ecosystem” and that he wants to play his part in making it healthy. He certainly does. Josh Kopelman, through FirstRoundCapital , is quietly filtering through just about every young web 2.0 company, and investing in many of them. Josh has a Wharton MBA and was the founder of Half.com, which was sold to ebay in 1998. His investments include Feedster, LinkedIn, Del.icio.us and, reportedly, Browster (and others). Josh understand web 2.0 better than most entrepreneurs. His experience as an entrepreneur and growing huge businesses out of whole cloth is an incredible asset. Fred Wilson is a founding partner of Union Square Ventures and writes the extremely popular A VC . If you are new to web 2.0, start with his Blogging 1.0 post. Then read the rest of his blog (even the stuff about music). Fred was the original lead investor in del.icio.us, back when people were still scratching their heads about it. That enough gets him on the list. But Union Square’s other investments , including indeed, could also be major home runs. It’s clear from his blog and what people say about him that he spends a lot of time working with his portfolio companies. He’s the kind of guy you want on your side when you go into battle. Jeff Clavier – Jeff is a former VC and still makes the odd angel investment (Feedster, Truveo, and a few others). His new venture allows him to work with pre-funding companies and get them ready for prime time. In the last year, he’s worked with Userplane, Buzznet, UltraDNS, Glenbrook Networks, Loomia and two other undisclosed companies. If you have a hot idea and need advice, funding, introductions and anything else, Jeff may just take you on as a client and do what it takes to help you be successful – but like a VC, he’ll have to be convinced of your potential. Brad Feld – Brad is a managing director at Mobius Venture Capital and writes a must-read web 2.0 blog called Feld Thoughts. Read his posts on Term Sheets if you are in the process of raising capital. I keep trying to meet him but haven’t yet. Brad’s investments include invested in NewsGator, Feedburner and Technorati. O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures – This is the only non-person on here. OATV just closed a $50 million fund to invest in young companies. Given the incredible access Tim O’Reilly has to these companies, OATV could quickly become an important fund in the web 2.0 space. Pierre Omidyar – Pierre founded ebay and is the Co-founder of Omidyar Network , where he’s invested in a number of interesting companies including EVDB, SocialText and Feedster, plus a few undiscloseds. And it’s always good to have a multi-billionaire on your side. Peter Rip – Peter is a founding partner of Leapfrog Ventures , a $100 million fund. Peter also writes Early Stage VC , another must-read blog. His investments include ojos, an incredible new photo-metadata service that is going to be extremely disruptive (and useful). Like others in this post, he’s a guy I’d want on my board. He’s gone through many battles as an entrepreneur in his time (he founded his first company in the early 80’s and worked at Infoseek in the late 90’s). Peter Thiel – Peter, the former CEO of paypal, has invested in LinkedIn, Friendster, LinkedIn and other web 2.0 companies. He’s just created the Founders Fund . Can’t wait to see what investments come out of it. There are three additional VCs that are yet to make notable investments. But they are laser focused on the space and are hungry to make investments in web 2.0 companies. You will find them at every event and seem determined to make a name for themselves. I include them here now because Ithere’s a good chance that when I update this list in a year, they’ll be at the top. Thomas Ball – Tom is a Venture Partner at Austin Ventures, a fund with $3 billion under management. He’s their consumer and web 2.0 guy and seems to be spending a lot of time in Silicon Valley and at web 2.0 events.  Prior to joining AV, Tom was an entrepreneur who founded a couple of successful Internet companies.  This adds a unique perspective to his investing philosophy in web 2.0.  He works actively with a number of AV portfolio companies including Pluck and, I suspect, will be making important investments in web 2.0 in the near future. Dan Grossman – Dan is a principal at Venrock Associates and has recently started a great blog called A Venture Forth (where he wrote a much bookmarked post on Ajax ). Prior to Venrock, Dan was at Garage.com. You’ll also find Dan at most web 2.0 conferences, and he’s made a huge effort to reach out to the community and network. Jason Pressman – Jason is a principal at Shasta Ventures, a young $200 million fund that has a deep commitment to and expertise in consumer-focused businesses. Jason was at Walmart.com and was part of a small group of executives that ran the place before coming to Shasta – he was VP of Strategy, Operations and Business Development. He has a keen insight into web 2.0 and has served as an advisor to a number of companies in the space. Jason knows how to grow startups to massive scale, and he is always thinking about which new companies he can help to achieve that scale.",,2005-10-19 00:00:00

,Web 2.0 This Week (October 9-15),https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/17/web-20-this-week-october-9-15/,"Tons of new companies launched this week. My guess is they were aiming for the Web 2.0 Conference last week but had to delay. This may have worked out for the best as the covereage they received was probably much better after the press chaos last week. Most bloggers have probably noticed that Dave Winer is back in the bay area. It’s good to have his brain around here again. I’ve been invited to a couple of his weekly breakfasts with Steve Gillmor. I try to keep my mouth shut and keep my listen to talk ratio as high as possible. These guys aren’t always right, but they’ve seen and done enough that even when they’re wrong, you can learn a lot by being around them. We said goodby to Richard MacManus , who stayed with us for during his trip to silicon valley. Based on how warmly he was received, my expectation is that Richard will be back soon. His eloquent goodbye post was excellent. We launched something called the Web2.0WorkGroup last week. It’s an experimental sandbox that a bunch of bloggers focused on writing about the new web are working on. Right now its a directory of participating blogs. Soon it will be much more. Here’s this week’s wrapup: Kahuna (update), Gada.be , Google Reader (update), Yahoo Blog Search , Google Bookmarks , Wink , MeasureMap (update), Memeorandum (update), Yelp , Qumana (update), RememberTheMilk , Sphere (update), PreviewSeek , Reading Lists , Inform Smart: Give the blogosphere an exclusive preview and announcement rights of your new product and let the accolades roll in . Dumb: Launch a product that breaks Firefox, ignore blogger input and give the New York Times an exclusive . Bloggers respond . Blog Herald reports that there are over 100 million blogs. Breakdown by country. Awesome. The BBC also reports that the web has grown more this year than ever before. Dave Winer is interviewed by Robert X. Cringley on Nerd TV. It’s a big download but worth it. I’m glad stuff like this is being recorded for historical purposes. It’s a cross between a rant and a classic essay , and it’s important. He’s continuing his theme of comparing search results on the existing blog search engines. Everyone said search was “good enough” before Google. Blog search isn’t even “good enough”. Massimo Curatella takes the time to list large-file sharing apps. Bookmark it. Oodle got it right when they went for the decentralized content approach. Craigslist felt threatened and turned them off. Oodle responds diplomatically. This is not great for Oodle, but I also think it’s not great for Craigslist. Data must be open. Sites that try to horde it will lose in the end. Fred Oliveira writes about Tagging , with a focus on why people tag. I hope he’ll still be in the bay area for Tag Camp on October 28 to share his ideas with that group. A post by Chris Pirillo launched a huge blog discusson on splogging and the fact that BlogSpot seems to be the main source of it. Google owns BlogSpot and has a clear incentive to allow this to happen – they serve ads on every one of these splogs. This is not a new problem. Google needs to take action. Dave took the first step . Yesterday he reached out again . These two guys need to work together to make the blogosphere and the web a better place to hang out. I hope they find a way.",,2005-10-17 00:00:00
,Healthline – Reliable Medical Information,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/17/healthline-reliable-medical-information/,"HealthLine , a very smart medical search engine with web 2.0 features, launched this evening. Tony Gentile, HealthLine’s VP Product Management, writes about it here . First, its a good search engine. Normal language is translated into medical terms, and refinement options are shown for related information. For instance, a search for breast cancer shows refinement options for “treatment” and “symptoms”, as well as links to the broader search of “cancer”. The HealthMaps feature is incredibly useful. It is a visual display of information relevant to your query. Do a search for “ cancer ” and click on the top left link just above the first result to see this. Clicking on any of the visual cues will give additional refined information. You can also see the HealthMap feature in the screen shot above. Refinements, along with HealthMaps, is a very good way to find relevant information with a single search on a term even loosely related to the information you are looking for. Healthline also offers browsing by channel, with topics ranging from Acne to Yeast Infections. If you become a member, you can create news alerts, and tag and save search results. You can also write reviews of articles and rate other reviews . This is an excellent resource.",,2005-10-17 00:00:00
,Goowy Charges Ahead,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/17/goowy-charges-ahead/,"Alex Bard’s flash-based desktop replacement Goowy , based in San Diego, has impressed me from the start. We originally profiled Goowy on August 17, 2005 and again a couple of weeks ago. Today Goowy released further functionality. First, they increased storage from 100 MB to 2 GB . While that storage is only for use with email now, they will soon be releasing a virtual file storage product, allowing users to really put that 2 GB to work. Second, Goowy released a flash-based desktop application that allows you to access core Goowy features without going to the site. Email notifications, RSS updates, calendar items, etc. are included. The look and feel is very much like Konfabulator , but we’ve noticed no performance issues on our machine as we did with that service. If flash is your thing (and maybe even it if isn’t), Goowy is for you. Let us know what you think of it.",Goowy,2005-10-17 00:00:00
,"Flock'S Refines Features, Expands Beta",https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/17/flocks-supercool-features-expanded-beta/,"Flock ‘s CEO Bart Decrem expanded the beta over the weekend to 1,007 people, most of whom are now blogging about it. The product, which was good back in August when I first tested it , is even better today. I’m a big supporter of Flock. I am even writing this post while wearing a Flock tshirt. Flock is definitely the Flickr of browsers. :-) The three most powerful tools Flock offers it’s users are bookmarks, blogging and a RSS reader. They’ve dropped their propreitary bookmarking engine and have replaced it with del.icio.us. I have a ton of del.icio.us bookmarks – thousands – and it took a while for the browser to chug through them all during the import procedure. But it did, and I now have one hell of an interface into my favorite bookmarking service. Since Flock supports tabbed browsing, I can keep bookmarks open in a separate tab and refer back whenever. Partnering with Del.icio.us is brilliant. I do not know if they have plans to integrate with other social bookmarking sites, but I imagine it would be fairly simple for them to do. The blogging tool was, and remains, absolutely the best I’ve seen. This tool brings flickr pictures directly into the blog tool, allowing simple drag and drop into the post. It’s dual-pane, with both wysiwyg and html interfaces (I actually preferred the old toggle method of changing from html to wysiwyg, but I’m not complaining). Setup is very simple. It just works. Flock also has a built in RSS reader that is both dead simple to use and yet powerful enough for heavy users. A simple drop down box can be accessed for any page that allows you to grab the feed for the page you are currently on, and add it to an existing or newly created folder. Feeds can be tagged, and the viewer allows for expanded or collapsed feed viewing. There are some speed issues with this version, 0.5, but in my opinion it has more than enough features to convince web users by the millions to switch from their default browser and go with Flock. Let’s launch this thing!",Flock,2005-10-17 00:00:00
,Previewseek – New Web Search Engine,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/16/previewseek-new-web-search-engine/,"PreviewSeek is a new London-based search engine created by Chris Hong that is very quietly impressing people with a number of innovating features. Basic search results are great but nothing to get overly excited about. The useful features include disambiguation of queries (are you searching for “apple” the fruit, or “apple” the computer”?), preview of search pages (think Browster), and better refining of searches. PreviewSeek does a good job at attempting to determine meaning from a query. Type in “ Java ” and you get a result set with a numer of options for the query, including the island, the programming language, and even the coffee. This is my favorite feature. PreviewSeek allows you to preview search results in much the same way as Browster (our profile ), except without the download and the ads. It’s a great way quickly scan results without actually clicking away from previewseek. For any given query PreviewSeek will suggest a number of refinement options on the left sidebar, which greatly assist in drilling down on a particular search.",,2005-10-16 00:00:00
,My Thoughts On Reading Lists,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/16/my-thoughts-on-reading-lists/,"Dave Winer has been thinking about, and recently writing about, a new idea: Reading Lists. OPML is a really useful file structure that just about everyone who uses a feed aggregator, like bloglines, is already using without necessarily knowing it. Most readers keep subscribed feeds for a user in OPML format, for easy importing and exporting. If you export your OPML feed you get a XML file of your feeds, which other feed readers understand. The problem with opml files from readers is that they are static, meaning I can give you my OPML file but you will never know if I add or delete feeds unless I tell you and give you the new file. All you get is a snapshot of my feeds from the moment that I share my file with you. Dave thinks these files should be dynamic, which means that I can share my opml file, or as he calls it my reading list , and anyone who subscribes to it will always have the current version, no matter how often I amend that list. There is very little technology needed to allow this to happen – the various feed readers simply need to agree to support dynamic lists and allow people to share them permanently. Dave’s trying to make this happen. If he succeeds, we’ll all be able to subscribe to reading lists from people we trust on a given subject, and good feeds will be that much easier to find. Fred Oliveira wrote about this recently as well. In a comment, Eric Lin writes: Yeah, exactly. As soon as people start to think about this idea, a lot of other interesting ideas start to spring up. A real world example of where we need this is our Web2.0WorkGroup . Feeds for each blog are linked, and we have a static OPML file that we are updating as new feeds join. However, because the file is static, anyone who downloads the file has to check back frequently as new feeds are added. Let’s automate this process.",OPML_Editor,2005-10-16 00:00:00
,Inform.Com Doesn'T,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/16/informcom-doesnt/,"Inform.com launched today with a splashy New York Times article. Steve Rubel has some kind words. Rafat Ali isn’t so kind – he says “It fails miserably.” I agree. I honestly can’t figure out what it is, even after reading the Times fluff piece. They say its an RSS Reader but adding feeds is anything but easy. Newbies need simplicity . Oldbies want something that handles a ton of feeds efficiently . This does neither. And if I simply want to know what’s hot in the blogophere, I use Memeorandum , which as I’ve said , is ugly as hell but it actually works . As an example, track this story on Memeorandum here . What it does do well is break. Early and often. They warned me that it was optimized for IE, but I’m a firefox guy and I charged ahead. Bad idea. Also, URLs are hidden. The UI is unworkable – even my scroll wheel on my mouse is disabled on the site. I try to find the good in new products, but I’m failing on this one. Please, tell me what I’m missing.",Inform.com,2005-10-16 00:00:00
,First Screen Shot Of Sphere,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/14/first-screen-shot-of-sphere/,"I met with Tony Conrad , one of the founders of Sphere , today at our office (ok, its a house, but it’s also an office – just ask the IRS). Sphere is a new blog search engine that quite frankly blows everything, and I mean everything, I’ve seen out of the water in terms of relevance (and, by the way, design…Adaptive Path was involved). The timing for this meeting was perfect – right on the heels of Yahoo’s new blog search engine , and Robert Scobles already-classic post “ The race to time-based and blog search “. Tony, along with co-founders Steve Nieker and Martin Remy, and advisors Matt Mullenweg, Mary Hodder and Toni Schnieder, have created Sphere in a very short period of time and for “less than $200k”. I saw the live site and was allowed to bang on it as much as I liked. I did, and came away very impressed. Relevance in blog search is very difficult. Google-type PageRank analysis, which looks at incoming links to a piece of content, simply doesn’t work because new content doesn’t have much in the way of links. Until now, no one has come up with a way to properly sort blog posts by relevance, and the general default way of showing results is “reverse-chrono”, which simply puts the newest stuff at the top. Sphere appears to have solved the problem, or at least taken big steps in the right direction. Their approach involves three key algorithms – an analysis of links into and out of a blog , an analysis of metadata around a post (links, post frequency, length of posts, etc.), and something Tony calls their “secret sauce”, which is content semantic analysis to filter out spam and to understand what a blog post is talking about. Result sets show only two posts per blog on the first page, so no one blog can dominate a category. The result set has auto-generated profiles of blogs that include recent links in and out of the blog, average posts per week, average words per post and a link to a full page profile that can be edited by the blog author. To the right of the main result set are blog (as opposed to post) links that are relevant to the query, and something they call the “Daily Sphere”, which is links to relevant non-blog news stories. I imagine they may add additional content in the side area as well. The results page integrates both ajax and flash features in an intelligent way (it’s not there just for show). While Sphere has been indexing blogs since January of 2003, their index only shows results for the previous four months. They will lengthen this window as they scale up operations. Sphere has tens of thousands of beta requests and is opening up to 100 lucky people this weekend. Sign up for the beta here .",Sphere,2005-10-14 00:00:00
,Qumana'S Simple Ad Inclusion For Blogs,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/13/qumanas-simple-ad-inclusion-for-blogs/,"Qumana is an excellent wysiwyg online/offline tool for editing blogs. We’ve written about Qumana before and described their service, which is completely free. Yesterday Qumana launched v 2.0 of their product. The primary feature addition is the ability to easily, very easily, add pay-per-click ads directly into blog posts. Ads can be positioned anywhere, and there are a couple of formatting options to choose from (see arrows in screen shot below). Revenues are split 50/50 between Qumana and the publisher. Ads are keyword driven based on tags you set for the post, and flow into RSS without any problems. Each Ad is tracked by keyword and clicks. Ads can also be previewed before final posting. The publisher has the flexibility to add as many or as few ads as he or she desires. There are additional new features as well, including improved old post edits, better drag and drop tools, and better integration with wordpress and blogger. This is the best tool I’ve seen for small (and large) bloggers to easily include ads in posts.",Qumana,2005-10-13 00:00:00
,Rememberthemilk To Do Lists,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/13/rememberthemilk-to-do-lists/,"RememberTheMilk is a new ajax-rich to-do list that is similar to 37 Signal’s Ta-Da Lists . RememberTheMilk lists are organized by tabs. Items are easily entered (although there is an extra click in there that bugs me). Clicking between lists is very straightforward. Items can be easily reordered. And you can also share lists and/or choose to make them public. One thing RememberTheMilk does very well is to allow lots of metadata to be associated with a single task. Priorities can be set with a nice color-coded system, and there is flexibility in setting done-by dates. You can also add notes to a task. A really nice feature is the ability to add tasks via email. Reminders can be sent via email, instant messaging or sms. You can also subscribe to lists via RSS. Overall, using RememberTheMilk is a much richer experience than Ta-Da Lists. Setting date reminders is particularly useful. However, there is a definite tradeoff in ease-of-use. Using Ta-Da Lists require no training, while I seem to be referring to the RememberTheMilk FAQs constantly to understand functionality. RememberTheMilk was created by Emily Boyd, Omar Kilani and a stuffed animal named Bob T. Monkey (I prefer live mascots myself). :-)",RememberTheMilk; 37-Signals,2005-10-13 00:00:00
,Wink – People Powered Search,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/12/wink-people-powered-search/,"Wink gave a brief demo at at Web2.0 last week and we were immediately hooked. Wink is still in private beta (you can request an account on their home page), but I’ve had a chance to talk with CEO Michael Tanne and I’ve been using it all week. At its core Wink is a search engine, and they’ve intelligently layered in shared user participation to give fresh, meaningful results that, Wink argues, can’t be found anywhere else. The key user participation features are tagging, rating and sharing. Core search results are provided by Google and wikipedia. A search query returns those results, which you can tag and rate from 0-5 stars. A zero rating help to block out spam and other bad content, eventually removing it from the index altogether. This user-created metadata (when aggregated) helps Wink return more relevant results to the entire community. Wink has taken del.icio.us bookmark data to fill out their results with rich tagging content right from the start. For future queries, tagged/rated results appear above normal search results. Also within search results is an area where Wink users are listed that have tagged results with the query used. Clicking on any user takes you to a page that shows all of their public tags and ratings. If you find that you like a user’s tags and ratings, you can subscribe to those results via RSS. There are a ton of other features as well that I am discovering as I use the service. For instance, you can create a “search set” (it reminds me of Rollyo ) that combines links to favorite sites along with tags. As a side note, people are realizing that user-generated metadata may be the key to improving search results. Google has taken early steps in this direction with their early bookmarking product. In our profile yesterday , one of the comments opined that Google may be experimenting in this area. Perfect timing for Wink!",Wink,2005-10-12 00:00:00
,Measure Map To Launch By Year End,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/12/measure-map-announcement/,"Jeffrey Veen of Adaptive Path writes about Measure Map for the first time today. Measure Map is an incredibly easy to use flash and ajax application that monitors blog traffic and analytics in many, many different ways. You can slice data almost every way imaginable. I’ll do a full review as soon as I have their permission. In his post, Jeffrey provides a screen shot of the dashboard of the application, the first to appear publicly on the web. I took this as permission to post my own screen shot to the left. They have not finalized pricing, but my understanding is it may be free for everything except real-time data. Jeffrey also says that the application should be launched by end of year. If you want to try it out sooner, request a beta account at their site . We’ve been testing and writing about (scroll through search results) measure map for some time, and are big fans. A funny side note: At the web 2.0 conference last week I was talking with Kevin Burton and Andy Smith about some of the new applications we are excited about. Measure Map came up, and they asked for a demo because they hadn’t seen it. Some tall guy in the room joined us and listened while I demo’d the product for them. That tall guy turned out to be Jeffrey Veen – I hadn’t met him in person yet and so didn’t recognize him. At the end of the demo, when I still didn’t know who he was, he started clicking links and showing data I didn’t even know about. Some of it was incredibly cool stuff. I looked at his nametag and everything of course fell into place. Very funny.",Measure-Map,2005-10-12 00:00:00

,Memeorandum Is Changing The Web,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/12/memeorandum-is-changing-the-web/,"I’ve previously profiled Memeorandum , and there are no major announcements or feature releases to spur this new post. However, something much more significant is happening because of Memeorandum, and I am not the only person to notice it. Robert Scoble, who writes about it often, says  “Anyway, sorry that I am fawning over it so much. It’s just changed my life, that’s all.” Dave Winer writes  “I find it’s changed the way I think about blogging. Not many of these tech gadgets do that.” If you don’t know about Memeorandum yet, check out the site and read my profile . Memeorandum is the “newspaper” for anyone interested in what’s happening right now in politics or technology . Regarding my statement in the title of this post, I really do believe that Memeorandum is forcing a subtle but important shift in the way many of us use the web. Memeorandum finds blog posts, newspaper articles and press releases that are being heavily linked to in near real time and puts them up on the site. The position and size of the headline is indicative of its importance (determined by number of links and other factors, such as how much people are writing about the linked content). The higher up and bigger the headline, the more important it is. And linking sites, the conversation , are clustered underneath the headline. This means you can find out in near real time what is important in technology (or politics), how important it is, and who’s talking about it. If you then post on the subject, you will be linked into the discussion as well. If I have limited time and I need to find out what’s going on, I turn to Memeorandum. I am on this site at least 15 times a day. I am finding that reading feeds in my reader (the old way I used to find out what was hot) takes much longer, has a much longer lag time, and significantly more noise (Memeorandum has virtually no noise – everything is relevant). So Memeorandum is changing my reading behavior, but it is also changing my writing behavior. It is much easier for me to find and read everything that is being written about a topic (Memeorandum also includes links to the real time search engines for additional material). I find that I am more educated on the topics I write about, and am writing more often about things the web feels are important at the time. It’s a damn ugly site , but it is the most useful tool I have to discover real time content on the web.",Memeorandum,2005-10-12 00:00:00
,Yelp'S Local Reviews,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/12/yelps-local-reviews/,"Yelp is a website that allows users to write and share reviews of local businesses. It also has social networking features (adding friends, groups, etc.) to share reviews with a trust network. The idea is that people generally trust their freinds’ recommendations. All of this user-generated content on local businesses, combined with the Yelp search engine, also provides great inventory for Yelp to sell local businesses contextual advertising. The basics of Yelp: create an account, fill in your profile, add friends and write reviews. Yelp attempts to auto-fill the business information on a new review. The review consists of a 1-5 star rating and a free text area. Searches bring up local businesses based on your zip code and include paid advertising above reviews. Yelp is available only in San Francisco currently and plans to expand to other cities over time. They are also rumored to be closing on a Series A financing. There are a number of other companies that are targeting local business reviews in an almost identical way.

,Google Targets Del.Icio.Us,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/11/google-bookmarks-tagging-launches/,"Google has quietly launched a nascent bookmarking and tagging product as a feature to search history.

Bookmark a site by clicking on the star next to a result, and fill out the metadata. There are some nice ajax features, including auto-fill for tags. Tags are space delineated and I noticed that the “,” key doesn’t work at all in the field – reducing tagging errors common to other applications. To see tagged sites, click on the bookmarks link on the left sidebar. Bookmarks also appear on your personalized Google homepage. Bookmarks are not public yet. If/once they are, this may be the first serious competition to del.icio.us (note that Yahoo’s product has had less than steller growth ).

There were hundreds of smart and interesting people milling about and cross pollinating their ideas. Our focus was on the new companies, of course, and we briefly wrote about each and every one of them in our two part post “The Companies of Web 2.0”. See Part 1 and Part 2 . Here’s this week’s wrapup: 1-800-Free-411 , iKarma , Ning , zvents (update), Flock (update), Attention Trust , Attention Trust #2 , edgeio , Google Reader , Sphere , Yahoo Podcasts I had the chance to meet Fred Wilson at the Web 2.0 conference – I only wish I was able to pick his brain for a longer time. He writes a much-discussed blog post on “point” v. “end-to-end” solutions. A point solution is a stand alone web service – think Flickr before its acquisition by Yahoo. An end-to-end solution is a group of services under one roof – think portals like MSN, Yahoo, etc. Generally, mass users like portal type solutions, but point solution are almost always better. Investors and entrepreneurs need to think about this, of course, when deciding on their eventual exit strategy. Must they aim to be bought by portals? If you are near Palo Alto, a must-attend event is TagCamp on October 28-29, 2005. Will you be there? Speaking of tagging, Barb Dybwad links to a Wired article on the subject that is worth the read. Tristan Louis analyzes the Weblogs, Inc. acquisition and comes up with some very interesting thoughts on the value of blogs. Richard MacManus and Om Malik take the analysis even further. Bottom Line: Inbound links are worth $564.54 each. I’d like to see the analysis done from a different angle – how much is an RSS reader worth? See # 6 below. Brian Benzinger writes a great post listing all of the various visualization tools for del.icio.us data. Hey Brian, per my #4 above, you owe me $564.54. :-) Bloglines released some great data and insights on their blog. While there are lots and lots of blogs, Bloglines says a blog is important if it has at least one subscriber – a fair measurement if you consider Bloglines’ market position (still dominant) and if you discount the fact that just about everyone subscribes to their own feed. By this measure, there are about 1.3 million “important” blogs. Four months ago there were 1.1 million such blogs. This makes up the “long tail”. Things drop off quickly from there. Only about 37,000 blogs have 20 or more readers, and only 437 have at least 1,000 readers. The scientific term they use for the big guys? “Totally Sweet”. :-) Thank you, CNet, for picking TechCrunch to include in your list of the Top 100 blogs .

,Gada.Be – Tag Meta Search Done Right,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/10/gada-tag-meta-search-done-right/,"Chris Pirillo has launched Gada.be today – a powerful tag meta-search engine that has an incredibly simple and thoughtful design. Shayne Sweeney is the developer who’s building Gada . Gada takes a query and runs it against sites like Google News, Technorati, Flickr, IceRocket, Amazon, Wikipedia, 43Things, etc. Searches can be narrowed via a drop down box to “photos”, “social” etc. for more specific results. The search itself, and any narrowing, are also accompished via the domain name. For instance, a photo search for “web2con”, the tag people are using for last week’s web2.0 conference, is also accomplished by the URL web2con.gada.be/p . The query is the subdomain, and the photo filter is the /p at the end. Allowing easy searches and filtering via the domain name structure is brilliant, and allows for very powerful mobile searches. Note also that the name “Gada” is extremely easy to type on a phone’s number pad. It’s likely that Gada will become a much-linked to site for definitive results on a term, in a similar way as wikipedia is today. Gada incorporates all relevant information in a permanent URL, and so becomes a comprehensive result set for a tag link. Gada also outputs search results in RSS and OPML, allowing users to easily subscribe to and organize searches. More on Gada on their about page .",,2005-10-10 00:00:00

However, some of the comments I’ve received to the post, along with a couple of emails, suggested some of my criticisms were off the mark. I took another look today and I must say that I was dead wrong on a few points. I’ve copied my “areas to improve on” below and have bolded text that was incorrect: The three innacuracies were: A quick look at the “My Subscriptions” link that is prominently displayed at the top of the reader shows that all of this functionality is included, and actually works quite well. Under this tab, feeds are shown, can be sorted (second circle below), can be deleted, and, perhaps most importantly, can be searched (third circle) using the “filter” feature. Clicking on any particular feed brings up the related posts in the bottom window. It’s actually a very nice intuitive UI. Google Reader is still painfully slow, but these features, which I previously missed, do much to make it a competitive product. In my opinion, the “my subscriptions” tab should optionally be the home page, reducing the necessary clicks to get there.",Google,2005-10-10 00:00:00

Unlike their podcasting product, released last night , the blog search product is not much more than a quick add-on to Yahoo News. Frankly, I am more than disappointed. Instead of launching a stand alone property, Yahoo has integrated blog search into Yahoo News. Blog search results are presented on the right side of normal results, in a side-bar type area. For an example, see this search on “Web 2.0” . I’ve inserted a big red arrow and blew up the image to more than twice the size we normally use so that you can actually see the results in the right area of the page. Yahoo has also integrated Flickr and My Web 2.0 results. It’s unclear how relevant the results are but at first glance there is significant room for improvement.

,"Google Reader – Beautiful, Needs Work",https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/08/google-reader-beautiful-needs-work/,"Google launched a web-based ajax RSS reader yesterday at Web2.0. The coverage saturated Memeorandum . Unlike Bloglines, which uses frames to avoid page refreshes, Google Reader uses Ajax. The reader is visually stunning and at first glance appeared to be a contender. However, upon further review we’ve found what we consider to be some serious structural flaws. The reader loads quickly and uses your stored gmail credentials to sign you in. Adding feeds is fairly easy via opml upload (which we did) or using the search bar. As you add feeds you have the option of adding tags (called “labels”). Individual posts are listed on the left – clicking on a post brings up the content in the view box on the right. Google Reader is actually Google’s second RSS reader. See Google IG as well, which Google launched in late July. Unlike Google IG, which targets light RSS users who only read a few feeds, their new reader is targeted at those who want to move through a lot of feeds quickly. There are a lot of positive features. The reader uses ajax quite effectively to avoid page refreshes and to create a great visual experience. Feeds can be tagged, and individual posts can be kept unread and starred. The search functionality is excellent, and adding feeds requires no knowledge of RSS, opml or XML. It’s all automatic. Search only pulls up feeds you aren’t already subscribed to. As I mentioned above, Google Reader is targeting heavy RSS readers. The product isn’t useful, however, for moving through a large number of feeds efficiently. Posts are listed in order of “relevance” (which doesn’t seem to actually sort things in any relevant way), or by date. I need posts to be grouped under the individual blog because I read some feeds first – Google Reader doesn’t allow me to do this and I am frustrated trying to find the authors I like to read the most. There is no search functionality within feeds already subscribed to, so there is no way to find this content. The reader is slow. Paging down through posts results in a long and unacceptable delay. As a side note, importing my OPML list took about 10 minutes. Since this was a one-time cost, it’s not that big of a deal. Since this is a web-based reader only, there is no syncronization. Google uses ajax instead of frames. While frames is an old technology, readers using it allow for multiple scroll bars – this means you can keep the feed frames locked while scrolling through individual posts. This needs to be addressed. There is no unsubscribe button for feeds. Google Reader is optimized for Firefox. It isn’t working properly on other browsers yet. Many of the feature limitations can be addressed, but Google Reader has a long way to go if it is going to seriously threaten existing heavy-duty RSS readers. Brad Hill also posts a lengthy review of Google Reader.",Google_Reader; Google,2005-10-08 00:00:00
,Will Sphere Solve The Blog Relevance Problem?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/08/will-sphere-be-blog-search-20/,"Om Malik writes about Sphere , a new blog search service that appears to be getting ready to launch. Sphere is taking a crack at building a more relevant blog search engine. Traditional link analysis just doesn’t work with blog posts because new posts don’t have time to gather links. Instead, Sphere seems to be be trying to determine blog authority on a given subject area, and determine new authoritative blogs based on who those blogs point to. From Sphere’s Learn More page: Of course, there is no way to tell if Sphere has cracked the blog search relevance problem until they launch. I’m looking forward to finding out.

Flock is expanding the beta group from a hundred or so individuals to a couple of thousand today. We begged a beta invitation to Flock a while back and wrote about it in a profile written on August 26, 2005 There have been significant improvements since then. The blogging tool is even slicker than it was before, with incredibly easy flickr integration, blog editing (dual pane with code/wysiwyg viewers) and other features. Bookmarks are now integrated with del.icio.us, which just makes so much more sense than their original idea of creating a separate social bookmarking product. Flock is looking like a very powerful and very beautiful product. The Flock offices are literally in a garage off of University Ave in Palo Alto. Most people were awake and coding when we stopped by in the early afternoon. Andy Smith , pictured left, was the lone exception. Garage, sleeping engineers, cases of Red Bull…a true startup is a wonderful thing. Make sure you read Rob Hof’s Flock essay on Business Week . It’s…very complete. :-)",Flock,2005-10-05 00:00:00

ATX also tells you if the site you are on is Attention Trust approved, and has controls to turn the recorder on and off. The data can be stored locally and/or shared with any number of trusted parties if you so choose. Attention Trust insists that companies using the data adhere to the Attention Trust principles . This information is incredibly valuable, of course, particularly when aggregated with others. Virtually any online company will be interested in this data, and will invent creative ways to incentivize customers to share their attention data with them.

,"The Companies Of Web 2.0, Part 1",https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/05/the-companies-of-web-20-part-1/,"The Web 2.0 conference kicked off today with a number of great workshops . The highlights for us were the Attention Trust board meeting ( posts  below ) and, of course , the Launchpad workshop where a dozen companies presented in an hour and a half. My notes on each company are below. Many of these have been profiled here before, and we hope to get full profiles of the rest up as soon as we can schedule interviews with the teams (if you’d like to talk to me, I’m the guy with a huge TechCrunch sticker on my laptop) ( Jeff Clavier also has a TechCrunch sticker on his laptop, but I’m not French, so you’ll know its not me :-) ). I’m breaking this down into two posts to keep it manageable. Here’s Part 1. Part 2 is here . Ross Mayfield spoke about wikiwyg , the first wysiwyg editor for wikis. He says its much more than a tool for wikis, however. It’s and “open source synchronous editor for the web” and his vision is that it will be used on many web applications beyond wikis . Want to try out Social Text for free? Mention web2con at socialtext and get a free five-user wiki for a year. Dave Pell presented Rollyo, the roll-your-own search engine ( profile ). You can create a mini-search engine from only those sites you trust or feel have relevant content, and then search against that personal search. He used a travel search example that was quite compelling – searching against just fodors, travelpost and frommers. Saved searches can be private, or public and shared with others. David Young talked about Joyent , a compelling network suite for small groups and companies that includes mail, calendar, contacts, files, etc., and allows developers to mash up systems on their data. Lots of tagging and “smart filters”. Open APIs to allow third party apps. Take the tour here . Rajat Paharia showed off his super-cool flash platform BunchBall . Rajat was also nice enough to give me a personal presentation earlier in the day. Rajat talked about how developers need both infrastructure and distribution to get applications out. BunchBall provides both – a slick flash platform (Flash 8 is required for some applications) along with open APIs, and new third party applications are automatically distributed accross the platform. Current applications include a number of games and photo-sharing. Rajar also says that Metaliq is creating a multi user texas holdem game, to be released soon. Check this one out. And contrary to rumors, Rajat did NOT beat me at tic-tac-toe while giving me the demo. He lies. :-) Ken Leeder talked about his new company, RealTravel . It’s centralized :-( user content with some really sweet tagging and search/find capabilities :-) . The idea is to leverage user content and social networking to create a personalized experience for travel shoppers and a more effective venue for travel industry marketeres. THus, hopefully, breaking the death spiral that the online travel industry is now in: a race to the lowest price. Satish Dharmara gave an absolutely stellar presentation of Zimbra ( profile ), although to be honest Zimbra is so damn cool and full of AJax awesomeness that he could have stood there and babbled and the audience would still have cheered. Zimbra is an “open source enterprise-scalable collaboration server with intelligent online backup and single mailbox restore. It has hierarchical storage management”. What does this mean? You can’t run it from the Zimbra website, but you can install it on your own server. It’s Outlook as it’s supposed to be. Read our profile . It (Zimbra, not our profile) rocks. Demo here .",Rollyo,2005-10-05 00:00:00
,"The Companies Of Web 2.0, Part 2",https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/05/the-companies-of-web-20-part-2/,"Here’s the second set of companies that presented at the Web 2.0 conference Launchpad workshop. See Part 1 here . My friend Ethan Stock showed off Zvents , which launched last night. We’ve written about zvents here and here . In a nutshell,  Zvents helps you create and locate the tens of thousands of monthly local events and has tons of awesome ajax, tagging and other web2.0 stuff. Ron Rasmussen talked about KnowNow, an interesting RSS-based alert system (they call it “elerts”). I’d like to understand this one better and am hoping to sit down with Ron this week. Ian McCarthy gave us a tantalizing presentation on Orb , which allows you to stream content from your home computer to any wifi device without the need for any hardware. It works extremely well for video, photos, etc. He even pulled up a video cam in his living room and used Orb to turn the light on. Cool. It’s PC only right now though. Michael Tanne took the password protections off Wink today so we could finally get a look. Wink is “people powered search” and methinks they are on to something powerful. They take basic search results and allow people to tag and rank them to create a much better result set. They’ve called their technology “tagrank”. Damnit, Michael, answer my emails and give me an interview tomorrow. :-) Matthew Gertner presented on allpeers , an open platform to develop applications on firefox. Allpeers is in private beta currently. Bart Decrem gave a Flock demo. What  more can I say about Flock? I love it in a way that isn’t natural. If they could find a way to integrate Pandora direclty into the Flock browser, I’d never leave my computer again. But seriously, I’ve got my hands on the new version and will do a full profile this week.

,Ning Launches!,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/04/ning-launches/,"Ning , also known as the official name for 24 Hour Laundry ‘s project, just launched. I actually had to keep myself from posting early because I was excited about it. Now that I got the word from them with the approval to post, here goes the unveiling. Ning is, and I quote, “a free online service (or, as we like to call it, a Playground) for building and using social applications. Social apps are web applications that enable anyone to match, transact, and communicate with other people”. So, what does this mean for the global audience? A whole lot. It means anyone can now get their ideas out there and build a project (some people would call it a mash-up ) in a few clicks, with no developer experience. And if you are a developer, you can pop under the hood and change it to your liking, no questions asked. The reason why I’m excited about it is simple: allowing people to build cool new stuff that they normally wouldn’t (empowering the users) is one of the best things you can do on the Web 2.0 space. If you think about it, back when blogging started it was also about allowing people to do things they weren’t able to before – publish content online. This is it, all over again, but instead of blogs, you get to build cool apps. This being said, get out there and try it. And we at TechCrunch definitely want to see what you come up with too, so drop us a note if you’re using Ning to build cool stuff. To the 24 Hour Laundry guys: congratulations for the launch!",ning,2005-10-04 00:00:00

,1-800-Free-411: Free Directory Calls,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/03/1-800-free-411-free-directory-calls/,"Directory assistance calls are expensive – $1 and higher – and yet 6 billion of them are made every year in the U.S. 1-800-free-411 is a new and brilliant service from Jingle Networks that provides this service to consumers for free. The service works mostly like normal directory assistance. You dial their phone number and go through an automated system that asks for the location, type of listing and listing name. While you are waiting for the number, you must listen to a 12 second advertisement from a competitor to the service. If you choose to use the competitor instead, you simply dial “1” to redirect your call. Another difference is that if there is no local advertiser for the business type you have requested, the business receiving the call hears a short message at the beginning of the call telling them that the call is via Free-411. A tele-sales group follows up with the business to try to get them to advertise. Free-411 claims a 13% success rate in converting businesses to advertisers. Free-411 gave a presentation at DEMO last week, which is available along with additional company information here .

,Ikarma Has Potential To Be Huge,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/03/ikarma-has-potential-to-be-huge/,"iKarma is an online feedback and reputation system that we’ve been kicking the tires on for a few days. While there are many closed, centralized feedback services that are quite useful (ebay’s feedback, for instance), they are a part of the service they support and cannot be leveraged effectively outside of those services. I think they may be on to something really big here, but in my humble opinion they need to embrace the ideas of open services and open data. If they do that, I can see important third party applications being built on the back of iKarma. I expand on this below under “What it Needs”. You can register for iKarma directly at their site or via an email from someone who would like to write about you. Once you’ve registered you get an initial five-star review from the iKarma team and are encouraged to add contacts and begin writing about people. If they aren’t members, you can invite them. A review consists of a star rating (0-5) and a free-text area. Your overall star rating is averaged among all reviews. If you don’t like a review , you can leave a comment with an explanation or choose to start a more formal challenge process. You can only leave a review for any given member once; however, you can edit all aspects of a review if you change your mind later. The basic service is free and iKarma plans to roll out paid premium services in the future. To see our iKarma profile, click the icon below, or here . iKarma does one thing, reputation, very well. It has a clean and usable interface and no bugs were found. I also like that comments can be edited later on if the author changes her or his mind. eBay has certainty that two parties have done business because they (eBay) close transactions and know who both parties are. A necessary limitation of the iKarma is that they have no idea if someone posting a review actually knows or has transacted with the person they are writing about. iKarma has mitigated this problem somewhat by creating a formal challenge process to any posted review. I really like the point system in eBay. There is no upper limit on total feedback and I believe people use eBay sometimes simply because they want to increase their overall feedback number. In contrast, the only objective measure of your iKarma is an average star rating. After a certain critical mass is built up, another postive review or two will not noticeably affect your score. I think iKarma (for business reasons) should change their system to create a points system similar to eBay. iKarma has an icon that you can include on a website or email (we’ve put one above). However, the icon would be more useful if it also told viewers your total iKarma score. Lastly, and most importantly, there are many new web 2.0 and other online applications that could deeply embrace a third party reputation system like iKarma’s. But for that embrace to happen, they are going to have to open up their data and their APIs and let people create mashups . I’m betting iKarma is hard at work building premium features to generate revenue. If I was running the company, I’d raise capital now (I don’t think they have), stop building premium features and focus entirely on opening up the APIs and data for third party applications. Good things will happen.

It’s a nice collaboration tool, but recently released products such as writely and jotspot live have much richer feature sets. Writeboard, which is free, allows a user to create a new document very quickly, password protect it, and add users who can edit the document. Unlike competitive solutions, you must use a special markup language to format text (no wysiwyg), you cannot upload images, and there is no ajax or other functionality to move content around on the page. It is also a little buggy – comments are not showing up at all on our test page. Frankly, if it wasn’t 37signals, who generally create awesome applications, we would not be profiling it yet. However, our guess is that they will be adding functionality quickly. We are also looking forward to the launch of Chalk .

Quite frankly, it’s many people’s opinion (ours included) that Writely , Jotspot Live , Writeboard , Chalk and others are ultimately addressing the same customer pool – those who want to create, share, and group-edit documents online. Zoho Writer is the newest entrant and is as good as the rest. Think Word + Group Editing + Ajax. It’s a rich ajax application that allows sharing and group editing, and, like Writely, has a great wysiwyg editing interface and excellent image import and manipulation features. In fact, it’s pretty much exactly like Writely, except they do not yet support Word format import/export  or tagging (coming soon). Check out Zoho’s BackPack-like product Zoho Planner too.

The event is sold out. It’s clear that a number of companies intend to launch this week, and so I expect we’ll be kept quite busy checking them all out. PubSub LinkRank , Skype Video , zvents , Jotspot Live , Rollyo , FilmLoop , Slide , OPML Editor , Goowy (update), CustomScoop , Writeboard , Zoho Writer Richard MacManus summarizes this week’s evolution on the web 2.0 definitional thinking, inlcuding Tim O’Reilly’s important essay on the subject. I also agree with Dave Winer – John Furrier may have said it perfectly in his comment to Om Malik : Stephen Baker says Yahoo will launch blog search this week. Information Week highlights new data released by Forrester Research last week. Ten percent of consumers now  read blogs at least once per week: Via Fred Oliveira on webreakstuff . John Musser creates a great visual matrix of current mashups on Programmable Web. Let’s see how long he can keep it updated before it is simply too complicated to be usable. Great stuff.

It’s very much like Writely , and Zoho has another product out that is very much like 37Signal’s Backpack . An interesting discussion sprang up almost immediately in the comments section, led by Jason Fried at 37Signals and Sam Schillace at Writely. Both comment that TechCrunch loses credibility by writing about companies that largely copy existing applications. Jason writes: Sam writes: These are two individuals that I respect greatly for their contributions to the web and so I do not take their comments lightly.

,Customscoop Offers Advanced Prospective Search,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/30/customscoop-offers-advanced-prospective-search/,"What I like best about CustomScoop ‘s new prospective search/press clippings product is that it is dead simple to use. I spoke to Chip Griffin , CustomScoop’s Chief Innovation Officer and founder, tonight about his new service. Steve Rubel has been testing CustomScoop and wrote about it earlier today . CustomScoop has had a successful high end search/clippings product for five years. Pricing ranges from $300 – $1,500 per month and includes lots of bells and whistles. The CustomScoop Personal product strips out many of those features and enters the market with a free version (allowing one search per account), with a paid version coming soon that allows more searches – the fee will be “substantially less” than the prices charged for their core high end offerings. CustomScoop is more more, and less, than existing prospective search engines like PubSub . More because they monitor sites not covered by existing prospective search engines (including pages without feeds) and because they offer much more tailored searches (language and country filters, more keyword inclusion/exclusion functionality, etc. Less because they search only 25,000 blogs, whereas blog search engines generally hit the entire blogosphere (tens of millions of blogs). However, CustomScoop, like Memeorandum ( profile ), carefully chooses what they consider to be the most important blogs that will supply their customers with pertinent information. In addition to the 25,000 blogs, CustomScoop also monitors U.S. Online News (5,000 sources),  International Online News (2,000 sources), US & EU Government Web Sites (7,000 sources) and Policy Web Sites (1,200 sources). Search results, as they come in, can be viewed via RSS, twice daily emails or on the CustomScoop website.

Search those sites for information that you know you can trust. And, see what other’s have created, and leverage those searches as well. To set up (or “roll”) a search, you are asked to name up to 20 websites, pick a category and tag the search. A search can be public or private – public searches are ranked by popularity and listed on the site. You can also share searches with others directly.

,Speaking Of Loops: Slide,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/28/speaking-of-loops-slide/,"Everybody wants to get media distribution done right. Slide and Filmloop both tackle the problem through a desktop application that is constantly updated with media items, scrolling to your hearts content. Contrary to Filmloop that is in closed Beta, Slide is out there and we’ve seen it for ourselves at our last barbecue . I’ll be honest about it and say I saw both applications (Slide and Filmloop) as yet-another set of applications that sit on your desktop taking screen real-estate showing you pictures (by now you’ve figured I don’t use the Dashboard Slideshow widget on my mac, I bet). After seeing slide in action, though, I actually liked it. Slide allows you to subscribe to content feeds by selected publishers or by your friends. This means that slide can become a useful tool on the job if you need to monitor graphical data, or it can be fun with your family if you want to keep watching new pictures from your loved ones. Me, I prefer the first. Initially I thought of a couple of applications, like monitoring webcams, graphical data or watching other kind of dataset that can be expressed through pictures. Then there’s the novelty uses like delivering music to selected people, etc. All in all, even if you don’t like when things take some desktop space, you may find some of Slide’s capabilities interesting enough to give it a try, so go download it and try it for yourself. I almost forgot that there’s now a TechCrunch channel for Slide, so if you want to subscribe to it, click here and the Slide guys will take care of the rest for you. Sadly at the time of this writing there’s no MacOSX version so I can run it on my own machine, but we have it running on our demos machine in the living room. Nicely done!",Slide,2005-09-28 00:00:00
,Jotspot Live – The Perfect Wiki?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/27/jotspot-live-the-perfect-wiki/,"JotSpot Live , a JotSpot company, launched today. They’ve created an awesome wiki tool that solves at least two common wiki problems – the specialized markup language and multiple simultaneous users. I love wikis. We have one . They are perfect for group collaboration. But wiki code is different from everything else and while it isn’t difficult, it’s silly to have to use it (note Social Text’s wikiwyg , however, which is a nice wysiwyg editor for wikis). And only one person can edit text at any one time. Jotspot Live solves both of these problems. It also doesn’t require any server software. It’s a dead simple wiki application. With a few feature additions (like link and image support) it will be good enough for most people to use. It’s built with Ruby on Rails and uses Ajax to allow dragging and dropping of text around the screen. Add users by adding their email address. The wiki has presence functionality, meaning it shows you who is live on the page at any time. Multiple users can edit text simultaneously. Abe Fettig , who is one of the people who built JotSpot Live, writes this about it: It’s not perfect. Brian Benzinger (who also writes about JotSpot Live here ) and I are editing a page right now and he’s found a bug that occurs when two users simultaneously  edit text. We also noticed that if one person logs off and then back on, two separate versions of the wiki page seem to run and each person only sees themself as “present”. Other problems: Slow load time, no image support, it doesn’t tell you who written or edited text, there is no page delete function and you can’t uninvite people once they are added. However, all of these bugs/feature adds are easily fixed. Fred Oliveira (TechCrunch editor) wrote a post on webreakstuff about problems with wikis and collaborative software in general in July 2005. He identified many of the problems that JotSpot Live addresses. Free for up to five wiki pages per month. Includes advertising. $5/month for up to 15 pages per month. No ads. $20/month for unlimited pages. No ads. There are no restrictions on functionality or number of users.

,Web 2.0 This Week (September 18-24),https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/26/web-20-this-week-september-18-24/,"We had a terrific turnout for our TechCrunch Meetup on Thursday and look forward to hosting future events regularly (at least monthly). It is wonderful to have so many smart, obsessive people in one house for an evening – the demos were absolutely fantastic and lots of cross-pollination occured throughout the evening. Thank you again to everyone who attended and posted pictures . Too much to fit in the summary this week. Stuff that nearly got in: And last week marked a new Google product of course, the first in…well a week . FilmLoop , Mefeedia , Placeopedia , ObjectGraph , Google Wifi , Feedburner (stats), Truveo , TailRank , Searchfox (update), VideoEgg , Remote Control Mail , Slawesome , Findory (update), Attensa (update). FeedBurner released new operating statistics on their blog on September 20, and  lots  of people  noticed  the  exponential growth . They are now managing 100,000 feeds and over 4 million people subscribe to those feeds. Our comments are here . We congratulate Feedburner on their growth and note that the trend is likely to reflect similar exponential growth in RSS usage across the web. So, congrats to all of us! Tim O’Reilly posts his Web 2.0 Meme Map on Flickr. As we all struggle with defining Web 2.0, visual cues always help. I’m not as excited about this as others, though. Simple is better.

Qumana finishes a survey of bloggers and publishes the results in two parts: Some of the data is surprising – 34% of respondents read 30 or less feeds, and the average blogging time per week hovers around 3-5 hours. Both of these stats are far less than I would expect. Lots of additional stuff there worth noting.

,Findory Adds Self-Evolving Feed Reader,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/25/findory-adds-self-evolving-feed-reader/,"Findory has a first-class personalization engine for blog and other news (see our profile on September 3, 2005). Findory has built up a loyal following in the nearly two years since its launch. However, many users requested the ability to include RSS feeds of their choice directly into their blog and news channels. Greg and Alex just added this functionality , making Findory nearly perfect as a news source and reader. Findory users now have the ability to add feeds directly into Findory – one at a time, via an OPML cut-and-paste or simply by directly importing your feeds from Bloglines, if that is your current reader. You can also import other users’ public Bloglines feeds. Once you’ve imported these feeds, the powerful Findory personalization engine takes over and presents posts to you in a personalized way, based on what you (and community members like you) tend to find interesting. Click on TechCrunch posts a lot, and you’ll start to see lots of new posts from TechCrunch and other blogs on new web 2.0 companies. Findory is squarely attacking the current efforts by Attensa , SearchFox , Personal Bee and others to present your feed information in a more intelligent and useful way. The standard readers quite simply don’t work for power users with 100+ feeds any more – and companies are trying very hard to find ways of sorting through this information for you before you start to read. And unlike Attensa (who hasn’t launched their personalization product yet) and SearchFox (in private beta, although you can get an invite fairly easily), Findory is live and open to everyone. Findory does not support folders, so if you tend to group your feeds that way Findory will not work well for you. If you methodically check your feeds and like knowing what order they are in, you may want to stick to your current reader. But it is very fast, and does group informaiton well according to interests. Inside Google , SEW , BlogHerald , Threadwatch , New Media Hack , RSS Compendium Blog",Findory,2005-09-25 00:00:00

The main new feature in the release is support for tagging of feeds, blogs and posts: Attensa is aggresively adding features to compete with other readers and has an excellent product suite. However, some (including Jeff Nolan ) have stopped using Attensa’s Outlook product because of reported difficulties in making these third party applications work with Outlook properly.

,Remote Control Mail Is A Great Idea,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/24/remot-control-mail-is-a-great-idea/,"Company:  Remote Control Mail Launched:  Will launch early October Funding : Closing Angel Round Location: Portland, OR (development also in Russia) RemoteControlMail will provide you with a permanent  (snail) mail address, gather all of your incoming mail, scan (the outside), notify you of its existence (with the outside scan), scan the inside if you like (for a fee), and then either forward it to you or shred it, on your command. You can sign up now for RCM. The service will begin working in a couple of weeks. Who would want this? Anyone who moves a lot or maintains multiple residences. Businesses that need a physical mailing presence in another city. People who are concernced about identity theft (everyone should be). Or people who just want more cyber-control over their real world mail. I spoke with the founder and CEO, Ron Wiener, today about RemoteControlMail’s launch a few days ago and got a better understanding of the service. Dealing with real, actual (snail) mail isn’t very much fun. An endless and prodigious trail of junk mail comes through our mailbox (and incidentally, only 17% of it is ultimately recycled). As a country we get over 200 billion pieces of mail a year. Remote Control Mail is the first company to try to solve this problem for us by virtualizing our real-world mail box. Once you register, Remote Control Mail assigns you a permanent mailing address and you can then redirect all or some of your incoming mail to that address. Upon receiving a piece of mail, RCM will scan the outside of the package or envelope and notify you of its existence via email or through the RCM website. You can choose to have the inside of the package scanned, and then either have the item forwarded to you (singly or grouped with other mail), or shredded and recycled. An example of your RCM mailbox: John Smith RCM# 1234 14525 SW Millikan Way Beaverton, OR 97005 Basic pricing is $2.50 per month + $.10 per mail piece and $0.95 per package. RCM charges extra fees for forwarding, scanning ($10.-$.20 per page), shredding ($0.1 per ounce) and archiving.

,Truveo – Video Search,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/21/truveo-video-search/,"Truveo is a video search engine that beta-launched a few days ago. Jeff Clavier, an investor, writes about Truveo here . If you are looking for video content, this is the place to go. Founded two years ago by a seriously smart team of search experts, Truveo is tackling the very difficult problem of creating metadata from video out of whole cloth – unlike text-based content, it is very difficult to determine context of video and audio content without a human to actually view it (which is error prone and doesn’t scale). Truveo takes an innvoative two step approach to indexing new content. The first step is a straight web crawl to find the videos. The second, more important step, is to create metadata about the content, beyond what is available in transcripts and feeds (most video content has neither). They’ve created a “ visual crawler ” that looks at surrounding content to determine context. The best thing is, this stuff actually works. Try searches for Hurricane Rita and Daily Show . There are advanced search options and preferences that will assist users in finding relevant content. Sadly, the “adult filter” is turned on by default. :-) You can also filter out paid content. The only thing I’d like to see added is RSS feeds for search. Dr. Timothy Tuttle – CEO & Founder Dr. Adam Beguelin – CTO & Founder Dr. Pete Kocks – Senior Architect Link",Truveo,2005-09-21 00:00:00

,Videoegg Launches,https://techcrunch.com/2005/09/21/videoegg-launches/,"VideoEgg , founded by three Yale graduates, launched at DEMO in Huntington Beach, CA on Monday. Given the light content on their website, my bet is that the folks at VideoEgg have been working quite hard over the last few weeks to get the product ready for release. VideoEgg is a web-based publishing service that allows users to capture video content from virtually any device and format and publish it to the web. Click here for an example featuring Buzz Bruggeman . At first glance, VideoEgg has some really excellent features. A live demo is available on their site, and allows you to drag a video into the viewer to get a taste for how easy it is to use. Flash 8 allows the viewing of videos with enhanced quality. From their launch press release : Lots of interesting information about the service above…and the last paragraph is really interesting. Publishers can easily integrate content directly on their website by simply adding a html snippet. This is something I really like about VideoEgg – it appears that they are really focused on making their product as easy as possible to use. I’ve downloaded their software (which seems to be off the site now) and am digging through a box for my video camera. I’m hoping to get some good content up and indexed on Truveo .

It looks like the basic concept is a secure VPN – you sacrifice having Google see everything you do to ensure that other people on whatever wifi network you are on cannot (wifi sniffing is easy and widespread, and many passwords are transmitted without hashing). Om Malik , GoogleRumors and Tris Hussey write about this. Google has not publicly commented, but there are a number of links referring to the service on the Google website: Is this web 2.0? Nope. But it’s interesting. And with all of Google’s recent product launches, the idea of Google Purge becomes, if possible, even funnier.

As noted by Dave Winer this morning (he told me yesterday something cool was launching today), FilmLoop took another step clser to launching, replacing a nondescript “sign up here” page with a full description and demo of their soon to be released product. Full details can be seen in their brochure here . Creating and viewing loops requires a client download. Creation looks to be simple – drag and drop pictures and images into your “loop” (I’m assuming they’ll have an API for this as well). You can send your loop to people (I’m thinking it’s an excellent way to share photos among family members). Public loops can also be searched for and subscribed to from the site. And multiple people can add pictures to a loop. And “With a simple click, frames can open to a zoom view, link to video, audio, ï¬‚ash, or directly to â€œclick to buy” or â€œbid” page on any website.

,A Profile Of Tagworld,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/11/a-profile-of-tagworld/,"Santa Monica based Tagworld has been quietly beta testing its product for a few months, and officially opened its doors earlier this week. They now have 75,000 members and are growing by thousands per day. The funny thing is that I had never heard of them before last week when I was contacted by Carmen Hughes of ignitepr for a preview. Tagworld is a huge project. At its core it is a blogging platform, and at first glance it appeared to be a sort of advanced Myspace or Tagged – a blogging platform that would ultimately appeal to teens and college students as its core market. But after meeting the founders and getting a first hand look at the deep features, it’s clear that it is more than just the next teen blogging hangout. There are advanced features that will appeal to a much larger audience. The site is still rough and a number of features are buggy. But given their early subscriber growth, it appears that they are on to something interesting. Tagworld was founded by Fred Krueger and Evan Rifkin , two serial entrepreneurs who’ve had a string of successful liquidity events. They’ve self funded Tagworld, which is six months old and has 20 employees. The site is going to try to own just about every web 2.0 experience of its users – blogging, bookmarking, photos and other media files, file storage, and tagging. They say they are going to have open data in and out, meaning if a user is really attached to say, Flickr, they’ll be able to integrate with those photos seemlessly. And they’ll have RSS and APIs to send data out. But their clear goal, as Fred said when we met, is to replace del.icio.us, flickr and blogger (among other services) for its users. All features are free to users (other than extended file storage); Tagworld makes its money from integrated advertising. Tagworld has a solid blogging platform that is based on user-included widgets (posts, pictures, tags, friends, media player, maps, etc.). Designing the site is done through an Ajax interfact that allows dragging and dropping for quick organization. The platform is based on widget objects. There are a bunch of widgets that have already been included (such as those mentioned in the paragraph above), and there is an API for third parties to create their own and share them on Tagworld. Blogs are easily customized by users, and more advanced users can take full control of the html as well. Tagworld has an advanced wysiwyg tool for editing blogs, including adding photos (resizing, positioning) and media files. A social bookmarking feature is included. They do not yet have a bookmarklet but the core functionality is on the site. Tagworld automatically takes a small screen shot of the page as well and includes it with the bookmark metadata. Bookmarks can be tagged, and shared or kept private. They are also building integration tools with other bookmark services such as del.icio.us. Tagworld has a decent tool for uploading photos. There’s a great flash module for showing off photos on the home page. Uploading media files is also easy, and there is a media player module to play video and audio files on the home page. Fred and Evan say that they will also have flickr integration into and out of tagworld for users who do not want to switch. They are still ironing out the details on this feature, but Tagworld is allowing a full gig of file storage. These files can be tagged, searched and integrated into the user’s website very easily. Uploaded media files can be played on the home page/blog by integrating it with the player widget. The first gig is free. They plan to charge “at cost” for additional storage. Everything on Tagworld can be tagged. People, posts, pictures, media files, other files, etc. Combined with search, it’s a very useful way of finding content. There are other nice touches as well. Search is well integrated with personal and community tags. RSS will be available soon. And they’ve done some interesting things with Ajax, such as a slider control to increase or decrease the search results shown on a page. Tagworld is not for everyone, but it may be for the mass consumer that is just starting to jump into web 2.0. I just checked the site. In the time it took me to write this profile, Tagworld added another 1,500 users. In the end, customer acquisition and monetization is all that really matters.",MySpace,2005-11-11 00:00:00
,Web 2.0 Workgroup Now Has 20 Blogs,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/23/web-20-workgroup-now-has-20-blogs/,"Richard MacManus, Fred Oliveira and I formed the Web 2.0 WorkGroup about a month and a half ago. We’ve now grown to twenty blogs: Our goal is to provide a list of high quality blogs that are writing about recent trends on the web. We continue to add blogs regularly and are working on a number of ways to make their content more accessible. Today, we’ve broken the blogs down into rough categories, provide RSS feeds for each blog and an aggregated OPML feed for those of you who’d like to subscribe to all of them. We will be adding more functionality soon. Please continue to recommend good blogs to us. We’re always looking for a way to expand the conversation.

It’s well thought through Ajax spreadsheet application, with very basic functions. They’ve added tagging, and you can generate a permanent URL for any spreadsheet, even without creating an account (non-registered spreadsheets will only be up for seven days, however). There’s also a great tool for importing the spreadsheet into a blog. See this post by Adam Marsh for an example. It’s more of an experiment than a truly useful application. I do not believe you can make spreadsheets private, for example. However, seeing stuff like this and writely make it extremely clear that a full office suite on the web is not only achievable, but should be here already.",,2005-11-23 00:00:00
,Feedster Top 500 Update,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/22/feedster-top-500-update/,"Feedster has updated their Top 500 List of Blogs . Scott Johnson, Feedster’s CTO, writes about it here . The first list was published in August. The new list incorporates recent links and has changed substantially from the previous version. In particular, they’ve added user tagging and a tag cloud to assist in search/find. The tagging interface is in Ajax (with captcha to reduce spam). I spoke with Scott Johnson last night about the new list. They’ve taken big steps to remove spam blogs and links, and will soon be tying authority to links to further refine the list. The Feedster list is very focused on recent links in, looking back only two years and giving additional weight to more recent links. The tagging feature is an interesting way to find blogs in the list. They’ve added a tag cloud on the right sidebar for easy navigation to specific types of blogs. For instance, click on “celebrity” and get that type of blog. Great way to drill down. And finally, Feedster will be adding “Import into Excel for Analysis”  and an OPML export of the feeds.",Feedster,2005-11-22 00:00:00

,Companies I'D Like To Profile (But Don'T Exist),https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/21/companies-id-like-to-profile-but-dont-exist/,"There are companies I review every day that I don’t write about. Reasons vary – it’s been done already and the product isn’t even as good as what’s been done, its a mostly or totally one-way application, or it isn’t consumer focused (or have implications for consumer focused applications). Even with this filtering, I get flame comments on some of the stuff I do choose to write about as “not worthy”. But there are a number of companies and/or products that I would like to write about but don’t exist. I’ve been keeping a list over the last few months and I am posting it now. Some of these are big ideas, some small. Some could potentially receive venture backing, most wouldn’t. But I believe that a viable business could be built by an entrepreneur around any of these, and I will be happy to profile them if and when someone builds them. In a way, this is number 11 in my previously post “ Top Ten Things You Can Do To Get Blogged “, but its also much more than that. And let me know if and where these should fall in Nivi’s matrix . 1. Better and Cheaper Online File Storage Photos, movies, music and important files take up a ton of hard drive space. I recently purchased a new desktop computer with a 250 GB hard drive, and the hard drive is full from recorded television shows that I haven’t watched yet. Yeah, I can buy a network drive for my house, but they are expensive and if the house burns down I’ve still lost everything. It’s amazing to me that all of us aren’t backing up our important files online regularly. As far as I’m concerned, the only reason is because no product has emerged to fill this tremendous demand, with the right features and at the right price. We need a good product. Something as easy to use as the Flickr uploader on the client side, and easy web access. These tools need to go a generation or two beyond what xdrive is offering. Features I’d like to see: drag and drop file adding and removing, an rss feed for my files, tagging of every file for easy search later, easy sharing, and the ability to publish files to the web with permanent URLs. And off location backups in case your building burns down. Pricing needs to be dramatically lower too. Find a way to make this cheap. Include ads or whatever, but this needs to be very low cost (remember that Google offers over 2 gb of mail storage for free). Xdrive is currently $10/month for 5 gigs. Even Godaddy, at $10/year for 1 gb, is way too costly. I have no idea what the cost economics for a business like this are, but plan for scale and give some amount, at least a gig or two, permanently free. No 15 day free trials – we see right through that. Give me a lot for free and let me scale up to, say 500 GB for $20 per year. 2. Blog/website Email Lists People can visit my site, and get the content via RSS, but I know of no quality service to allow people to subscribe to my site via email. I hate to rip on Feedblitz , which is really the only choice right now, but it sucks. It’s orange. Really ORANGE. I want the look and feel to be TechCrunch, not theirs. I want people to have the option of getting an email every post, every day, or every week. I also want to know that I and I alone control these email addresses so that they will not under any circumstances be misused. If I change services, I want to have an easy export feature to take these with me (OPML would be nice). I also want access to real time stats. The number of emails, type of subscription, how often they are opened and what things are being clicked on. And users need a very easy way to stop the emails. I’m willing to pay for this. Probably as much as $20 per month. A free version should be offered too that’s add supported and maybe doesn’t have the analytics. I’m frankly amazed that Feedburner chose to partner with Feedblitz to do this instead of building it themselves. It wouldn’t be that hard to build. And the Feedblitz interface disaster wouldn’t be detracting from the Feedburner brand. 3. Portable Reputations eBay’s Feedback system is arguably their biggest asset. Even with its flaws, it is one the biggest drivers of trust between two people buying and selling who’ve never met and never will. But it’s a closed system, usable only within eBay and only for eBay transactions. We need an internet-wide identity and feedback system that any reputable application can tap into, both pulling and pushing data. A couple of companies have taken tentative steps in this direction, but they have until now kept the data in their own silo, demanding people come to their site to provide feedback. I reviewed iKarma , one of these, in October and practically begged them to change their business model. So far they haven’t. Opinity is much the same, although they offer partners the opportunity to tap into the data. These centralized data plays have no chance on today’s internet. Why even bother. Here’s what we need – a referee and a scorekeeper. Open (I didn’t say free, mind you) APIs in and out, not just links to feedback scores. Figure out the rules (keep it flexible) and let other applications feed the database. Somebody please build this. Or eBay, open up your Feedback API. I’m not alone in pleading for this. See what Rob Hof and others have to say as well. 4. Tailored Local Offers (via RSS) Build a website. Let users give as much or as little demographic and personal information as they wish. Partner with a big sales force that already has access to local businesses (citisearch, yellow pages, whoever). Offer me (via email, website and RSS) special offers from local merchants. $5 off a pizza. Free first time dry cleaning. A cup of coffee. Whatever. I’ll eat it up (and so will everyone else). 5. Facebook, in other countries Somebody ‘s gonna do it. Why not you? 6. Free Music Music will someday be legally free. There is just no other way. Artists, label and promoters will need to make money in other ways. Limited edition cds and dvds. Concerts. Tshirts. Whatever. Face reality and do it sooner rather than later. 7. Open Source Yellow Pages YellowWikis is sort of on the right path, but drop the wiki aspect (as I’ve said before, wiki’s are hammers, but not everything is a nail), add tagging and make it open source. Or at least open APIs in and out. Make money from local ads and premium listings. 8. Podcast Transcriptions Podcasters need transciptions. Many people don’t have the time or inclination to listen to every podcast they want to. Search engines can’t index the content. Transctiptions fix both problems. Hire transcribers in a low cost country. Offer podcasters reasonably priced transcriptions (bonus: in multiple languages). I’m thinking $10 per half hour. Partner with the podcast directories, search engines and tool providers. Mint money. 9. Decentralized Review Aggregation There are millions of passionate reviews of every product and thing you can think of sitting out there in the blogosphere. Don’t try to get people to re-write all this stuff. Leverage tagging, RSS and, eventually, microformats to aggregate it and make it searchable/findable. Wonderfully, chaotically decentralized. Ad supported. 10. Build Something Cool with SSE Figure out how to leverage this before everyone else does and build something beautiful and amazing. UPDATE:  Richard MacManus adds a few ideas of his own. UPDATE:  Adam Marsh adds my startups into Nivi’s/Ethan’s matrix, using numsum. Wow, numsum is pretty cool.",,2005-11-21 00:00:00

,Why I Don'T Like Riffs,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/20/why-i-dont-like-riffs/,"Riffs , a review site for anything, launched quietly last week. It  takes a hybrid wiki/social bookmarking approach. Any user can add a URL to begin a discussion (or just begin a discussion without a URL), and the Riffs community votes on the thing and discusses it in wiki fashion. All pages have RSS and the clean interface has some great Ajax features. Riffs also has tagging, including “common tags”, which I think is interesting. So why don’t I like it? It’s centralized content. All of the content resides on Riff’s servers and they require people to go to the site (in one way or another) to add content to the discussion. And in this case it seems absolutely crazy to architect their service this way. Reviews are everywhere on the web today. And the most exciting place to find reviews in on blogs. Try it – search on “whatever” and “review” and you’ll see thousands upon thousands of high quality reviews on just about anything all over the blogosphere. Riffs approach is to try to get in the middle and generate a centralized discussion by people who want to talk about a subject. They are staying as open as possible by creating RSS feeds for each page, and my understanding is that they may be creating tools to allow people to push the content they create at Riffs out to their blog, like flickr does. And it seems to me this is their core mission – to become the flickr of reviews. Not “flickr” in the joking way that everyone says when something is trying to be the cool new web 2.0 application, but literally, the place people put their review content and then pull it out for their blog if they choose to do so. Fred Wilson writes about the service and addresses points similar to those above that I made on CrunchNotes and Jeff Jarvis made on his blog. Jeff and my point: Blogs are the place to write content. Microformats and tagging will help people do this. My additional point: And they already are doing it, at massive scale. Fred’s retort:: I disagree with Fred on this. Flickr is a useful “edge feeder” because it has tools for managing photos that go way beyond what most bloggers have. And more importantly, they host the pictures for you at no cost. Reviews are different. They are easy to write, easy to publish and cost very little to host. What we need is a service that takes all of this great content out there and pulls it into a centralized place for search and find (and further discussion), but which always points people back to the original post. Back to Riffs, I really do like the wiki/communit aspect of the service. But they need to find a way to grab their data from the edge first and foremost. If they can do interesting things with it, then they can be successful. I know why they aren’t doing this. All that open data out there…anyone can take it. If Riffs is successful with my suggested approach, what stops others from doing the same? My answer? Absolutely nothing. But their current approach doesn’t even put them in the game. I say find a way to aggregate that data and relate it into a discussion somehow, like Memeorandum does on a smaller scale. Then you’ve got a big company. But you better hurry up. Some guys are already circling the wagons .",Riffs,2005-11-20 00:00:00

The thing I liked best about this party was that Tara Hunt from Riya and Andrea Reinhardt from Just Starting Up took care of everything – Fifty something pizzas, 20 or more cases of beer, wine and champagne , bags and bags of ice, the A/V system for the demo and tons of tshirts and stickers. Tom Conrad from Pandora chipped in with a complete music system . And it was a great crowd. My pictures from the event are here . Here’s everyone’s tagged “ TechcrunchMeetup4 “. The rumors about a Google acquistion were neither confimed nor denied by anyone in the know…but there sure is a lot of buzz around this company right now.

,Advertising On Techcrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/18/advertising-on-techcrunch/,"As many of you know, writing TechCrunch is and has been a hobby/obsession of mine for over 5 months now. To this point, TechCrunch has not generated revenue of any kind, other than a couple of thousand dollars paid by sponsors of our third meetup to offset party costs. Revenue generation from advertising isn’t and won’t be the primary goal of this site because the value of TechCrunch isn’t in page views, but in networking (I agree with Dave Winer almost entirely on this). However, I’ve had the opportunity to join John Battelle’s Federated Media Publishing along with a number of really great blogs. The main reason I’ve done this is to associate with these other blogs and cross pollinate ideas. Another benefit of the network is that they seek out appropriate advertisers for blogs. As part of my commitment to FM Publishing I’ll be placing some ads on TechCrunch. I’d like to get feedback from TechCrunch readers on how they feel about this. In addition, I’d like to get an understanding of what types of advertisements you may actually find useful.

I’m hoping they include other email applications over time – like Mail and Entourage for the Mac. A lot of people overlooked Waxmail as just another audio recording tool. But I’ve found that I use it more and more often. There is just something very cool about recording a quick sound file to accompany certain emails. It’s sometimes easier to say what you think sometimes rather than write it. It’s especially useful when emailing a picture, chart or other visual document that needs commentary.

It is a rumor, however, that has been confirmed to me by employees of companies that were also apparently in the hunt for Riya but dropped out after the price became too rich. These rumors will certainly make Riya’s launch party at my house tomorrow night even more interesting. I want to stress that even though I know the Riya folks and even though I am hosting their launch party, I have no direct confirmation of the deal from them (and yes, I’ve tried).

,Hyper-Contextual Search Results With Swicki,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/16/hyper-contextual-search-results-with-swicki/,"Eurekster’s Swicki search service officially launches later today (November 16, 2005). Eurekster, a twenty person company located in San Francisco and New Zealand, has a profitable business (called Search Publisher) that provides customized search results to a number of large websites. Steven Marder, Eurekster’s CEO, tells me Eurekster’s current products are generating 25+ million monthly searches. With Swickis, they’ve taken the basic technology and added on a “do it yourself” interface to allow a much larger number of sites, particularly blogs, to also integrate search direclty into their content. Swicki’s are “community powered” in a sense and their website focuses on this. And certainly the community has a role in creating more relevant results. But what really interests me about their technology is that the tweaking by the publisher along with community actions combine to create extremely contextual, or hyper-contextual (my words, not theirs), search results. Two somewhat different examples of live Swickis (they’ve been in private beta for a while): see our Web 2.0 Workgroup (scroll down a bit) and Jeff Clavier ‘s right sidebar. Swicki’s are based on Yahoo’s search API for base results. The publisher customizes the search engine by adding keywords that are always added to the search results. And, in a similar way to Rollyo , Swickis allow for the publisher to name specific websites that have content relevant to the search. For instance, a gaming site may include other gaming website URLs as important, and Swicki will put results from those sites on the top. A publisher can also block results from certain blogs. For our Workgroup , we selected all participating site URLs as the most relevant content. Swicki’s also have a related “buzzcloud”, which is a tagcloud of commonly searched terms. The buzzcould can also be edited by the publisher to add or remove terms, and a spam filter disallows any single IP from influencing the buzzcloud results too heavily. Swickis are completely free. They will soon have contextual advertising served along with normal search results if the publisher chooses, but there will be no penalty or fee if they publisher wishes to keep advertising out. They are also adding analytics to allow publishers to monitor search statistics. A press release should be out soon and I’ll link to it once it’s available. Check out their blog as well for a post. Brian Benzinger posted a long review of Swickis last month when they first went into private beta. Thanks Susan for introducing me to the company.",,2005-11-16 00:00:00
,Is The Gawker-Yahoo Deal Important?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/16/is-the-gawker-yahoo-deal-important/,"Gawker , a blog network similar to Weblogs, Inc., and Yahoo announced a syndication deal today that brings Gawker content to Yahoo News . Content from the largest Gawker blogs is already included – Wonkette, Gizmodo, Defamer, Lifehacker, and Gawker itself. More may be coming. The financial terms are undisclosed, but here’s what is now on Yahoo: Gawker brands and content are pushed throughout the news home page . Clicking on associated content pulls up a Yahoo page with the Gawker content ( example ). It does NOT redirect to Gawker. There is a single link to Gawker on the content page (clicking on the brand name). Otherwise, it’s an all-Yahoo experience. If I was doing the deal, I’d expect a revenue split in Yahoo’s favor on ad revenue generated from the page. Gawker gets that revenue, the branding, and some links directly to the blog. This is purely speculation, but my best guess. Is this an important deal? Yes, in that it shows Yahoo embracing blog content. The guy at Yahoo to get to know is clearly Scott Moore, named by Wired in their last print edition as VP Content Operations. Scott is hiring bloggers (such as Kevin Sites) and doing these kinds of deals with Gawker. These are smart deals for Yahoo – they generate page views where they can put lots of ads. If the deals are revenue share, then it’s a no lose proposition for Yahoo. But what Yahoo is noticeably not doing is acquiring Gawker, like AOL did with Weblogs, Inc. That means liquidity events for bloggers are limited – the GYMs (Google-Yahoo-Microsoft) are not yet in content buying moods. So perhaps the networks and very large blogs can cut deals to increase page views on content and generate revenue. Will this model work for the long or medium tail of blog content? My guess is no…the GYMs will want to control quality and that doesn’t scale with more than a small number of blogs. But certainly we’ll see more deals like this, particularly as long as the advertising market is strong and demand for inventory is outstripping supply. The portals need content, and this is a cheap way to get it. A lot of people are focusing on the fact that the deal is incorporating  blog content directly into Yahoo news results. While I find this interesting, we’ve already seen Yahoo experiment with this with their blog search product . Clearly Yahoo is defining the definition of news to include blogs (as they should), and I applaud this. But back to the title of this post. Is it an interesting deal? Yes, but mostly because of what the deal isn’t – it isn’t an aquisition of Gawker. Read more analysis of the deal at Read/Write Web , Paid Content and Memeorandum .",Yahoo,2005-11-16 00:00:00

,Google Base Launched. Yuck.,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/15/google-base-launched-yuck/,"Google Blog officially announces the launch of Google Base .  We previously anticipated the launch of Google Base (along with everyone else) in late October . Bottom Line : This is not a very interesting application in its current form. Keith Teare says it’s like a 1985 dBASE file with less functionality. It’s ugly. It’s centralized content with less functionality than ebay or craigslist. The content is not integrated directly into Google search results, but “relevance” can bump it up into main and local search (and froogle). Rob Hof’s at Business Week is also blase about it. He says “eBay and others may not have much to fear just yet” Additional information and FAQs on Google Base in the About section . Features: There are two ways to upload data – a web interface for one item at a time and a bulk uploading option to send content in XML. I’ve tested Google Base out. The general idea is that you pick a category for your post. There are suggested categories – course calendars, events and activities, jobs, reviews, wanted ads, etc. You can also create your own category. Each category has its own fields to ease data input. For instance, the “vehicles” category includes fields for vehicle type, year, make, etc. You fill out any or all of these fields, add additional fields (called “attributes”) if you choose, and add a title, description and keywords (tags). You can also upload a picture or point to a picture on the web. I found a few bugs in this form. For instance, adding “techcrunch” as a tag failed because it was “misspelled” and it simply wouldn’t include it. Once I removed the techcrunch tag I was able to add an expiration date and post my test content, which is published after a short delay, along with a permanent URL (this is just a quick test). Once content is published, it can be edited from a dashboard. Content can also be searched at Google Base. The above screen shot is a search for “recipes” . Clicking on a particular item pulls up its permanent URL (example), where full details can be viewed and the posted contacted via email. Brian Benzinger has a more positive review here . And check out what Dave Winer has to say (“It’s microcontent without the schemas”).",Google_Base; Google,2005-11-15 00:00:00

,Google Analytics Swings At Measure Map,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/14/google-analytics-swings-at-measure-map/,"Google took the wrapper off Analytics today. It is a rebranding of their Urchin acquisition from earlier this year. It works in much the same way as MeasureMap – using it requires the addition of javascript into a couple of files on your blog. It has deep integration into Adwords as well. Google Analytics is mostly free (up to 5 million page views per month), or completely free if you are an adwords user. Registration for Analytics is currently suspended but I’ll be doing a full side by side review against Measure Map in the next day or two. The screen shot provided by Google (to left) is encouraging. One thing I’d like to understand is whether Google Analytics takes a holistic approach to blog analytics like Measure Map does, or whether it is a more generic application for measuring general website statistics. Measure Map is awesome at monitoring traffic at the post and comment level and has used flash and Ajax integration in a very intelligent way. More on the Meme . UPDATE: The site has been down all day and they have suspended registrations for now. The bigger problem appears to be that Google didn’t notify Urchin’s paid subscribers ($200/month) that the change was going to happen, and those subscribers have no access to their data right now. Ethan Stock tells the story and he is pissed off .",Measure-Map; Adaptive_Path,2005-11-14 00:00:00
,Amazon Tags,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/14/amazon-tags/,"Amazon is integrating user tagging into product pages (see image below). Tags are public by default and can be managed under a “your tags” area that I am failing to find. You must first select a “Real Name” (odd choice of names given the old company called RealNames). Once you’ve signed up and started adding tags, you can delete them or make them private in the management area. Amazon tags will make it easier for you and others to find relevant content. I wonder how they are going to handle spam tagging and other bad content, though?. Another, possibly more interesting feature would be to allow publisher tagging. The tags would likely be more relevant (and spam easier to track). See Richard MacManus for more on Amazon Tags.",Amazon,2005-11-14 00:00:00
,Yahoo Shoposphere Just Launched,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/14/yahoo-shoposphere-launches-tonight/,"Yahoo Shoposphere launches tonight (well, officially at 6 am EST tomorrow, but I’ve gotten permission to write about it tonight). I met with Rob Solomon, Yahoo’s GM of Shopping, and Sabrina Crider, a Yahoo PR Manager, last week to take it for a test drive. Yahoo is making a major push into search personalization and recommendations – the overall project is called “Shoposphere” and the major feature being released is called “ Pick Lists “. Their goal is to move ecommerce towards what they call “me commerce”. Any registered Yahoo user can create a Pick List. Yahoo has allowed users to create “uber lists” of bookmarked shopping items for a few weeks now. Items may be saved to a public or private list. Pick Lists are a subset of these uber lists. A user selects any number of items from the 75+ million unique products in the Yahoo Shopping catalog, names the list, adds ratings and comments for each item, and publishes it to a permanent URL. My “Web 2.0 Gadgets” Pick List can be viewed here . Like the list? Say yes or no and vote on it. Want to leave a comment? Add it at the bottom. Really like it? Subscribe to the RSS! The more people that vote for a Pick List, the higher it will appear in the Shoposphere. There are a couple of features being added in the near future. The first is tagging – all lists will be able to be tagged by users and the list creator for easier search (compare this to Amazon Tags , which I wrote about earlier today). The second upcoming feature is revenue sharing. Yahoo expects many users to promote their Pick Lists and some will generate significant traffic. Yahoo Shopping earns revenue a number of ways from its shopping platform – clicks to vendors, overture ads, etc. They plan to share some of these revenue streams with Pick List publishers, giving publishers a bigger incentive to publicize these on their websites. Yahoo will provide promotion tools for picklists, similar to the flickr badges seen all over the web. Yahoo is also hoping to use Pick Lists to promote more long tail items from Yahoo Shopping. While Yahoo will continue to promote various items throughout shopping, they can rely on user generated Pick Lists to push deeper, less known items as well. Yahoo is also releasing developer APIs to allow mashups with other applications. Rob Solomon says Pick Lists are just the first major feature of the Shoposphere, and that they will be releasing new consumer driven merchandising soon. For another interesting experiment, check out Yahoo’s Mindset , an Ajax search interface which allows users to change search results based on whether they are more interested in “research” or “shopping”. It will be interesting to see how all of these features come together.",Yahoo,2005-11-14 00:00:00
,Ajaxed Domain Names Search,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/13/ajaxed-domain-names-search/,"Instant Domain Search is a great, simple Ajax tool for finding available .com and .net domain names. Enter a desired domain, and results appear instantly as you type. There are links to Yahoo and Register.com if a domain is available and you’d like to register it. If the domain is not available there are links to the whois registration information. This is a useful and timesaving tool for people who buy a lot of domains. One thing I’d like to see is a backorder link for domains that are already registered.",Instant_Domain_Search,2005-11-13 00:00:00
,Pandora Is Now Free,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/10/pandora-now-offers-free-option/,"Pandora , the great music disovery service and player, is now offering a free version of its service. Pandora has hired 30 musicians who have spent years analyzing 400 attributes of songs, like melody, rhythm and vocals. They’ve analyzed over 10,000 artists and 300,000 songs to date. Users pick a band or song to get started, and create a “channel” based on that type of music and which you can stream over their site in high quality audio. Over time, by telling Pandora whether or not you like a given song, the channel will evolve. You can share these channels with other Pandora users. For more information, see our profile (one of my more effusive) from August 20, 2005 .Pandora launched nine weeks ago. Before today, Pandora charged $12/quarter or $36/year after a 10 hour free trial. Now, users can choose between a free, ad supported version of Pandora, or choose to pay for the service without ads. Users who have paid for Pandora previously will have the option of having their money refunded, or an extension added to their subscription. Quarterly subscribers will have a year added to their account, and yearly subscribers will have two years added. Pandora has also added new features, including a favorites list, increased feedback functionality for tailoring stations, better playlist generation and dozens of other minor tweaks. Pandora has 1 million stations based on 70,000 unique artists or songs.",Pandora,2005-11-10 00:00:00

Fotolia launched yesterday. Fotolia is a site where photographers can sell their images directly to consumers. They offer only royalty free images ( Getty Images , for instance, offers a mix of royalty free and rights managed images). Photographers keep up to 80% of fees. Three types of rights may be purchased – web only, print only, and exclusive buyout. The exclusive buyout option results in the image being removed from the site,and no futher sales of the image are made after that. Fotolia has created an innovative pricing system to encourage use by photographers and manage the user experience. Photographers may price photos within certain ranges determined by their rank . The more sales a photographer has, the higher their rank. Prices start at zero and can be as high as $2,000 for an exclusive buyout. The site is very well designed, and they’ve integrated Ajax previews of images along with photographer tagging of images for easier searching. They have multi-language support (including blogs in four languages) and RSS for all results pages. After a 6 month limited beta, Fotolia now has 100,000 images online.",Fotolia,2005-11-10 00:00:00
,Techcrunch – After 5 Months,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/10/techcrunch-after-6-months/,"Tomorrow, November 11, is TechCrunch ‘s five month anniversary – my first company profile (Technorati) was on June 11, 2005. I’ve been blogging personally for some time but this was my first attempt to write for an audience larger than my immediate family and friends. It’s been a wonderful experience – and I have countless new friends (bloggers, readers, entrepreneurs, journalists and venture capitalists) that I’ve met directly or indirectly through writing TechCrunch. If you’d like to know why I started TechCrunch and how it’s evolved, please read my post here on the companion blog I started, CrunchNotes (CrunchNotes is where I write about stuff that interests me but that doesn’t strictly belong on TechCrunch). I thought I’d share some TechCrunch stats that I find interesting. Readers have grown at a pretty steady rate. I think this is a reflection of general growth in the blogosphere, and the fact that I am writing about all of the interesting new companies that are popping up on the web. To really understand web 2.0, you have to look at the companies. That’s all I do here. We’ve grown to about 9,000 daily RSS readers. Page views swing wildly from day to day depending on what links are coming in. (from feedburner) I really like seeing where the rss readers are reading my feeds. These also change around a bit, but the current breakdown (rounded up or down) is: (from feedburner) I’ve always found it interesting that Firefox is the most popular browser of TechCrunch readers, even though their total market share is only around 10%. This stuff has to scare Microsoft…blog readers are the early adopters. (from measuremap) These are the ten most popular TechCrunch posts: (from measuremap) I want to thank everyone that reads this blog, has been written about in this blog, and the many people who’ve taken the time to link, comment and give me advice.

,Tag Your Books With Library Thing,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/09/tag-your-books-with-library-stuff/,"Writing about Etsy yesterday got me fired up on tagging again, so I am going to write about at least two tagging sites tonight that I’ve been testing. The first is Library Thing , which is turning into quite a nice service for tagging your real-world books. Registration is simple – give it a username and a password. No other personal information is requested. Adding books is just as easy. So many people are using Library Thing (they recently accounced they had 1 million tags ) now that a simple search on an author or title will most likely pull the book up, which can be added to your catalog with a single click. You can also input ISBNs if you like. Quickly add tags, a rating and a review if you like. It’s fast and easy to add books and metadata. Library Thing is free for up to 200 books, with a premium service for more books. I love the last sentence in their FAQ for pricing: Library Thing also just released a new feature called “tag info pages” which has lots of information on a given tag. Here’s Fiction , for example. Listal is another company that does this, although Listal also allows information on dvds, games and music. If you are really into books, go with Library Thing. If you have a big collection of all media, go with Listal. And if you have a mac, use Delicious Library , which lets you scan books in with a digital camera, saving countless hours. I have a lot of books. And I move a lot, often to other countries. Moving books sucks and so I’ve moved most of them to my parents house in Washington. Since my parents have are retired and have a lot of time on their hands, I’m hoping to get them to do all of the hard work in uploading the initial book data. Dad, how ’bout it? :-)",Listal,2005-11-09 00:00:00
,People Tagging With Tagalag,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/09/tag-people-with-tagalag/,"Tagalag is a service that lets you tag people , via their email address. It’s not a “tribute” site like 43 people , because only people who know a person’s email address can add tags for that person. If you create a profile you can add personal and geographical information about yourself. I don’t know if Tagalag is onto a viable business model, but I like the idea of tagging people. This could become interesting as it evolves.",,2005-11-09 00:00:00

Somehow a post I wrote on Facebook back in September is the number two search result on Google for “ Facebook ” and the post is consistently one of the top three traffic generators for TechCrunch.

Digg allows anyone to submit news stories, and other users vote on how important the news is. More popular stuff moves to the top of the site, eventually gaining front page promotion.

Newsvine will be a collaborative, social news site. Like other sites, Newsvine will show major news publications. However, readers can comment on news items, allowing for a discussion to ensue. They are also adding tagging. Any user can bookmark a news piece (or any web page) with a tag such as “sports” or “Iraq” and it will become available at Newsvine under the URL newsvine.com/[TAG]. If you are interested in seeing news on a given tag, you can of course go straight to that URL as well. Newsvine will use a voting system, like Digg, to determine how relevant a given news item is. I think these user-determined ranking systems, like Digg and Memeorandum, are a great way to push good content to the top. I’m looking forward to seeing this live.

,Etsy – P2P Commerce With Tagging,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/08/etsy-is-ebay-20/,"A relatively new company called Etsy has recently captured my attention. Etsy is a P2P ecommerce company (like ebay) that currently limits sales to handmade items. It’s smart to focus on a niche to iron things out…and Etsy could easily expand into other categories as well. Etsy does lots of things like ebay – They charge sellers a listing fee and final sale percentage (although at $.10 and 3.5% they are way below what ebay charges), there is an ebay-like feedback system (side note: there is a huge market waiting out there if someone would create an independent third party feedback system with open data and APIs), and they have integrated paypal as a payment option. Unlike ebay, Etsy has architected the buyer experience from the ground up using web 2.0 priciples. First, Etsy has a very flat taxonomy – top level categories such as Bags & Purses, Toys, etc. Everything underneath these top level tags is based on seller tagging. For instance, look at the “Bags & Purses” category and note the tags (called subcategories) on the right hand side. Click on anyone of these and you go deeper into the taxonomy…although really it is a folksonomy. Further refine items by clicking on additional tags, or on a different set of tags based on materials used to produce the product. The benefit of this folksonomy is that it is user generated and based on popularity. If a new item gets hot fast, the folksonomy will take that into account. It’s a beautiful use of tags and the first launched product I’ve seen that does this. Etsy also does some amazing things with flash – the geolocator on the home page is a great way to find sellers by location. You can also use their “shop by color” widget…less useful but an interesting feature. Finally, they have a time machine feature, although I can’t figure out what it does. Nice product. It looks like more features are coming, too. Check out their blog .",Etsy,2005-11-08 00:00:00

There are four lists currently and my understanding is that they plan to expand the number greatly in the near future. The current Lists: The feeds from each list are availabe in opml format, and they’ve created an aggregate RSS feed for each list as well. This is a great example of Reading Lists – edited, dymanic opml feed lists. It can also be compared to Technorati’s Blog Finder , which ranks related feeds as well. The difference is that Technorati relies on publisher tags to determine content topic for a blog, whereas Pubsub relies on a human expert to determine which feeds should be included.

,Comparing The Flickrs Of Video,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/06/the-flickrs-of-video/,"I’ve been tracking a number of sites that offer flickr-like services for video. I’ve taken a look at as many of these services that I could find. The most well known is YouTube , which we profiled in August and which recently raised venture money from Sequoia. But there are at least eight others worth looking at as well. In addition to YouTube, these are CastPost , ClipShack , DailyMotion , Grouper , OurMedia , Revver , Vimeo and vSocial . Instead of writing individual profiles on each of these, I’ve created a quick chart that give a basic overview of the features. I’ve included only those companies that provide a web-based (v. client) service that hosts the videos on your behalf. Because of these requirements, great services like VideoEgg ( profile ) are not included. Here’s the chart. I’ll update it as needed. Most of these companies convert video to Flash. This reduces file size significantly and also allows most platforms and browsers to easily view the content. Two, Vimeo and DailyMotion, convert files to quicktime instead. A couple do not convert the files at all. One benefit of those services which do not convert is that the files can be downloaded by others, emailed, etc. QuickTime format can also be downloaded. One service that has a unique feature is Revver. Much like FruitCast for podcasts , Revver will auto-insert advertisements directly into your videos and share revenue with you. A couple of additional notes. Grouper has not launched their video publishing product yet. When it does launch there is a good chance it will involve a client download which would remove them from this list. Also, while I’ve noted which services allow tagging of videos, there are a wide variety of tagging options within these services, and many of them also provide comments, rankings, etc. and which are not noted in the chart. Finally, the tools to allow blogging, friends lists and other sharing are varied and more useful in some products than others. Which product is best for you depends on what types of features are most important to you. UPDATE: I’ve updated the chart above with more information. People have left great comments and have included new companies I’ve missed. If you are associated with those companies, please email me relevant information and I’ll include it in the chart. The most interesting comment is from Vinu, who tells us that he heard a rumor that Flickr will be adding video support soon.

It’s still in private beta, although you can get a good understanding of the service by watching the how-to video they’ve created. Barb Dybwad likes the effort YackPack has put into creating a very simple user interface. I agree that a child could use it, but I don’t think the walled-garded functionality will ultimately be popular. Other minor annoyances with the service: I was forced to give up too much personal information to register (such as my zip code and birth date), you can’t edit a sound file before you send it, and you cannot access the actual sound files you record – they must be listened to at the site. YackPack plans to provide a free, ad supported service along with a premium option for “ well under $10/month “.

,Odeo Disappoints,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/04/odeo-disappoints/,"My patience with Odeo has run out. The first time I wrote about Odeo was on June 13, 2005 . The service actually launched on June 22 , about the time that iTunes 4.9 was released and hit the podcasting world like a ton of bricks. Odeo had tools to listen and sync, and a directory (iTunes, iTunes,and iTunes), but lacked the feature that everyone was looking forward to: the podcast creator. It was the sole feature that made Odeo different from iTunes. Fans eagerly awaited its release. In the 4-5 months since the product was launched, Apple has released yet another version of iTunes and Podshow raised nearly $9m from Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia. Did Odeo release its studio tool? No. Instead, they released a desktop widget . Last week Odeo did get its studio product out. It’s visually appealing. But it is so feature poor that it’s effectively a non product. Creating a recording is very straightforward. Click a button to record. Click another one to stop. It’s built on Flash. You can choose to add a picture to the podcast. It can be made public or just shared with friends, including by email. If you share by email, a link is sent to the recipient (v. directly sending a MP3 file). And…that’s it. Don’t like part of the podcast? You have to start over. No editing tools. No effects. No enhancements. Nothing else whatsoever. All they’ve done is turn on your microphone, turn it off later, and record what happens in between. The guys at slawesome built this in two weeks a couple of months ago. Waxmail did something similar and attached it to Outlook. This has been done already at least twice . By the way, if you want a free open source editing tool for podcasts, try Audacity . It’s what I use. Odeo is not an innovator. At best they are a follower. I’m hoping they start building new and interesting podcasting features soon. But for now, even nonprofits are way ahead of them in doing interesting things with audio. Odeo: What are you going to do to make your product relevant?",Odeo,2005-11-04 00:00:00
,Google Lunch?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/04/google-lunch/,"As many people know, Google offers its employees free lunch and free dinner at the campus (Yahoo charges its employees). It’s a lavish affair, with many different types of high quality food, drinks, desert, etc. I like visiting Google for lunch, and accept nearly every offer I get from a Google employee. To get into Google’s internal offices requires a discussion with security, sign in, badge, and escort. However, the dining area has no specific security into or out of it. If you can get past parking security, you can walk right in and eat. Like much on TechCrunch, this is pure rumor. But I’ve heard from multiple independent sources that non-Google employees are making a game out of getting onto the Google campus, without an escort, and eating a free lunch, often taking a second lunch “to-go” for dinner. These people are keeping score to see who can eat the most free, unescorted lunches at Google. And specifically, my understanding is that many or all of these people are Yahoo employees. Yahoo HQ is right down the freeway, a very short drive away. Have other people heard about this, or tried it (anonymous comments are fine)?

,Amazon Finally Reveals Itself As The Matrix,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/04/amazon-finally-shows-itself-as-the-matrix/,"Amazon’s new Mechanical Turk product is brilliant because it will help application developers overcome certain types of problems (resulting in the possibility for new kinds of applications) and somewhat scary because I can’t get the Matrix-we-are-all-plugged-into-a-machine vision out of my head. The “machine” is a web service that Amazon is calling “artificial artificial intelligence.” If you need a process completed that only humans can do given current technology (judgment calls, text drafting or editing, etc.), you can simply make a request to the service to complete the process. The machine will then complete the task with volunteers, and return the results to your software. Volunteers are paid different amounts for each task, and money earned is deposited into their Amazon accounts. Amazon keeps a 10% margin on what the requester pays. The name “Mechanical Turk” is a great one because it refers to a machine built in the 18th century that played chess against real people and beat them regularly. However, nearly a hundred years later it was finally revealed that the machine was in fact powered by a human being hidden inside of it. I actually read a book about the machine earlier this year – I was on a business trip and it was all I could find. There are an enormous number of tasks that this can be used for. So plug in to the Matrix Machine and give it a try. More on this from Rob Hof , Greg Yardley and others .",Amazon,2005-11-04 00:00:00
,Technorati Extends Search Functionality,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/03/technorati-extends-search-functionality/,"Niall Kennedy at Technorati has just informed me that they have quietly updated their tag search engine with full boolean search functionality. In August, Technorati added the OR function to tag search. On a search for “apple OR microsoft”, the results would include any posts that included either tag. While useful, this functionality essentially just reduced the number of searches a user needed to perform to find posts with relevant information. They’ve now added AND and NOT functions, which significantly help narrow result sets for specific searches. For instance, a user looking for blog posts on both Microsoft and Web2.0 (89 results) can now easily find those results, instead of sifting manually through a much larger result set for just Microsoft (16,627 results) or Web2.0 (5,717 results). Technorati has in an instant just given the user the 89 results that he or she really cares about. The NOT function is just as useful. Want to refine the result set above even more? Try “ microsoft NOT office NOT windows NOT msn AND web2.0 ” to narrow it down to just 66 results. Yes, these are advanced functions, but as the number of blog posts continues to skyrocket and publisher tagging is becoming more ubiquitous, users need tools to quickly refine result sets and find what they are looking for. By adding this functionality, Technorati made tagging more valuable.",Technorati,2005-11-03 00:00:00
,Insert Ads Into Podcasts With Fruitcast,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/03/insert-ads-into-podcasts-with-fruitcast/,"Fruitcast launched today. It’s a service that automatically inserts 15 second sound advertisements directly into a publsiher’s podcast (either at the beginning, or the end, or both). They’ve focused on keeping things ultra simple. You simply publish your podcast through a feed they create for you, and the advertisements are auto-inserted. They already have a couple of blogs signed up for the service. It looks like they are paying out on a per-download basis, and the site suggests that podcasters can expect to receive $0.25 per listener. That’s a hefty $250 CPM to the advertiser…which is way above what radio stations charge for ads. Fruitcast was created by James Archer’s Forty Media in Mesa, Arizona. Brian Benzinger has additional information on SolutionWatch .",,2005-11-03 00:00:00
,Office Live Will Be A Huge Productivity Tool,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/02/office-live-will-be-huge-productivity-tool/,"The other product announced yesterday at the Microsoft Preview event in San Francisco was Office Live . Office Live will launch in Q1 2006. My raw notes from the event are on CrunchNotes , and my profile on Windows Live went up last night. Rajesh Jha presented the product. Office Live is not an online version of Office. Office Live is a set of free, ad-supported productivity tools for businesses that will really help the small guys. The service will also have a premium subscription product that will have “less” ads, according to Bill Gates yesterday. The core tools are a free non-microsoft domain name, website and up to 50 email accounts with 2 GB of storage each. Rajesh created a new website in the demo, adding content and images, in a minute or so. For a small company needing a informational website, it will be great. Given that the domain name, website building, hosting and email will all be free, this will be very attractive to a small business. For customers needing more, Microsoft will offer a suite of additional productivity applications – 22 in all were announced yesterday. They will also support third party applications – ADP’s payroll software was shown integrated into Office Live. A set of APIs will be available for third parties to add their application functionality into Office Live. Among the additional applications was an office document collaboration tool. You can share an office document real time with others, allowing them to view and edit it. Impressive. Office Live should become a starting point for small businesses wanting a web presence and a general platform to run their business operations. If Microsoft can hold on to them as they grow by offering additional services, it will become a lucrative product for them. And the ad inventory they will generate from page views will also be highly valuable to advertisers selling into the small business space. There is a real chance Office Live will be one of the big revenue generators for Microsoft, both from advertising and subscription fees.",Office-Live; Microsoft,2005-11-02 00:00:00
,New Yahoo Maps Shows Power Of Flash,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/02/new-yahoo-maps-shows-power-of-flash/,"An all new Yahoo Maps  launches tonight at 9 pm PST. I spoke with Paul Levine, the General Manager of Local, Jeremy Kreitler, a Senior Product Manager of Maps and Local, and Diana Vincent, a PR Manager, earlier today about Yahoo Maps. Unlike Google and Microsoft maps, Yahoo has chosen to use Flash over AJAX in building its new service, and they’ve added new features that are not found anywhere else. They’ve also done some things to reduce the hassle of creating, sharing and printing maps online. It’s built with on the new MacroMedia Flex platform for flash, something we’ve been hearing a lot about lately. Because Yahoo Maps is a flash application, it avoids the need for page refreshes changes are made to the page. A simple drag and drop module on the top right lets users move around easily (even easier than the great Google drag method). There are multiple ways to zoom into and out of a map, including using the scroll wheel on the mouse, or the page up/down buttons on the keyboard. The arrow keyboard keys also allow for scrolling off-screen to new areas. There is excellent integration wth Yahoo Local businesses. Once a map is pulled up, a quick search, such as “pizza” pulls up all local restaurants. A click shows more information, and options to add it to the driving directions itinerary. And this is cool – they allow multipoint directions, something Google and Microsoft don’t have.. add as many stops as you need, in the order you want, and Yahoo Maps will calculate driving directions for the whole trip. This could be really useful when house hunting, for instance. Simply add all of the addresses and get an itinerary. And as you edit the map by moving, adding things, etc., the URL in the browser bar self updates so that it can be copied and pasted at any time. This is something that really bugs me about Google Maps – the need to click a link to get a permanent URL. Yahoo’s solved that with some cool javascript coding. Because Yahoo Maps is built on Flash, the “back button” on the browser still works (a problem with AJAX applications). At any time you can back up into older maps and the URL also rewinds. Yahoo Maps requires the installation of Flash 7 or greater. 90% of U.S. and European computers already have it installed. Yahoo has two flavors of APIs for developers . The syndication API is a simple way of bringing Yahoo Maps into a website in either Flash of AJAX. They’ve also launched a richer Building Blocks API for maximum flexibility.",Yahoo_Maps; Yahoo,2005-11-02 00:00:00
,Windows Live And Office Live,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/01/windows-live-and-office-live/,"Microsoft is announcing Windows Live and Office Live, both online services, right now (10 am PST) at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. I am publishing my notes and pictures real time at CrunchNotes . Windows Live is “live” at Live.com .",Office-Live; Microsoft,2005-11-01 00:00:00
,Windows Live – More Than An Ajax Desktop,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/01/windows-live-more-than-an-ajax-desktop/,"I blogged my raw, unedited notes from the Microsoft press meeting today real time on CrunchNotes . One of the two major announcements was Windows Live (best viewed on IE of course). Office Live was also announced, which I will be writing about later tonight. Windows Live is a free, ad-supported AJAX virtual desktop. Most of the functionality could be seen in the Microsoft sandbox project called Start , which we profiled a couple of months ago. However, Microsoft has added plenty of new features that add a lot of value to the product. Among them are email integration, a new instant messaging client, plaxo-like contact management and skype-like features that allow outgoing calls to normal POTS phones. Windows Live is also extensible via “gadgets”. After what I saw today, I despair for many a silicon valley startup. The core features include a (now) standard AJAX desktop, wich a drag and drop interface, options to change the number of columns, ability to save searches, etc. There is a pre-populated feed reader on the left column, and adding new feeds is a one-click affair. The really special stuff, though, are the Gadgets . These are third party applications that can be added to Windows Live via the Add Content feature on the top left. For current gadgets, check out MicrosoftGadgets.com . One Gadget I added was the Flickr viewer. Adding it takes a couple of steps, and you are able to view Flickr photo’s via tags. Since anyone can create a gadget, I’d expect to see thousand so options in the near future. You can add a mail account directly to the Windows Live page and get Outlook Express-like functionality directly on the browser. This technology looks to come directly from the Kahuna project, which we have written about several times. This was the coolest thing I saw demo’d today. Windows Live will soon have a new instant messenger client embedded on the site.  The IM feature will include the ability to make outbound POTS calls, like Skype. They’ve leapfrogged Google’s Gtalk in this regard. There is also an advanced contact management feature that bakes in plaxo-like features (you control your own contact info and people pull it to keep updated). Blake Irving walked us through a demo that included a search for restaurants near the TransAmerica Building in San Francisco. As he zoomed in and narrowed his choices, he chose a restaurant, and via a click called the resaurants’s normal phone line to make a reservation. I took a picture, which is up on flickr . The VOIP caller is pictured to the left. The IM functionality will be released in December. That’s all I’m going to profile for now. Additional features are discussed at ideas.live.com . I want to repeat, what really got me today was the Gadget extensibility and the full VOIP IM integration.",Live.com; Microsoft,2005-11-01 00:00:00
,Coursecafe Adds To The Social Bookmarking Discussion,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/31/coursecafe-adds-to-the-social-bookmarking-discussion/,"CourseCafe is a search and social bookmarking tool for students that the founder, Puneet Gupta, demo’d at TagCamp last weekend. The company is located in Mountain View and is angel funded. At first blush, the question came to mind as to why students can’t just use existing search tools like Google and social bookmarking applications like del.icio.us to handle their research needs. After the demo I understood why CourseCafe may be compelling for students to use on top of existing services. The site, which is currently under closed beta, has automatically uploaded entire course schedules for most colleges and universities in the U.S. Students can quickly add the courses they are taking. As the company gets some history behind it, the bookmarks saved from previous semesters in the same course will stay available to students, giving them a good start on finding relevant web documents. Search is integrated directly into the site using Yahoo and Google APIs. A bookmarklet is also available for sites found outside of CourseCafe. Bookmarking and tagging a link is straightforward and functional. All students of a course that bookmark items will be able to see other’s bookmarks, creating additional value for students (and reasons to use the site). There are other great features as well, such as limiting searches to .edu sites. CourseCafe is young and raw right now. But if they can find a way to tap into the college crowd like Facebook has ( our profile of Facebook ), there’s a good chance they’ll have some success. There are obvious product extensions as well, such as hosting notes and other course information.",,2005-10-31 00:00:00
,The Open Source Rss Reader,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/31/the-open-source-rss-reader/,"I’ve been using Blogbridge for a few weeks now. It’s the first time I’ve seriousy used a desktop application to read feeds – I really like web based readers because there is no software download, compatibility issues, etc., and because many of the desktop readers are not free. But so many Blogbridge fans have emailed me suggesting I try it out that I did. And based on what I’ve seen, I give it a thumbs up. Blogbridge is also open source. The founder, Pito Salas, tells me that there are at least six non-employee developers contributing to the project. There is a business model – Blogbridge eventually hopes to roll out premium features on top of the open source code base. For now, everything is free. Blogbridge comes in three flavors – Windows XP, Mac OS X and Linux. It is written entirely in Java. There are new releases weekly – the current release is v. 2.7. The default user interface is three panes. Folders on the left, feeds in the middle and posts on the right. Importing OPML files is a snap, you can read feeds offline (a big benefit over web based readers), and they are actively supporting Dave Winer’s Reading List idea (although no integration yet). Each pane has scroll bars, meaning, like Bloglines, you can scroll through the pane without losing your place in other panes (something that drives me crazy with other readers). Like all readers it seems, Blogbridge does a poor job properly rendering HTML, so posts look a little off. Blogbridge also has expert guides to assist users in finding feeds relevant to their interests. Lots of people I know and respect are on that list, including Richard MacManus , Jeff Clavier , Dan Gillmor , and Shel Holtz . I’m a big fan of open source projects, and Blogbridge is an excellent reader. Blogbridge is located in Arlington, Mass.",,2005-10-31 00:00:00
,Tag Camp Photo Album With Picaboo,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/31/tag-camp-photo-album-with-picadoo/,"I first heard about Picaboo from Robert Scoble a few days ago. Picaboo is a way to create, share and print photo albums. Picaboo was founded in September 2002 by Howard Field and Kevin McCurdy, and is funded by Kleiner Perkins and Softbank. They launched in May 2005. It only works on Windows right now (although Mac user have built in software for this stuff that works very well already). Picaboo requires a client download and the album editing occurs on this client. While I’d prefer a web app (flash or ajax), having a desktop client does speed things up considerably. Picaboo is free to download, and creating and sharing albums is also free. They generate revenue from the sale of printed albums and dvds. A printed photo album is $25 plus shipping and includes up to 20 pages. Each additional page is $2. I spent a considerable amount of time this evening test the software, creating an album and sharing it with Brian Benzinger to test out the features. The user interface is extremely easy to use and required little or no help or FAQ reference.You simply upload pictures, choose a format for the album, add text, etc. There are a wide variety of album choices. You can also add music, or any other sound file (commentary, for instance). One thing I didn’t like is that the pictures must be locally stored before uploading. You cannot, for instance, give it a flickr username and use those pictures. Once you’ve created an album, you can share it with “pals”, who can, if they’ve downloaded the picaboo software, view the album and add to it, creating their own version. You can also publish an album to the web for viewing by anyone. For some reason, the web version of albums will not play any music or other sound file you’ve assocated with it (a serious flaw in my opinion). I used photos from last weekend’s tagcamp event to create an album, which can be viewed here . You can’t hear it on the web version, but the soundtrack I added to the album is, in my opinion, perfect. Let me know what you think.",,2005-10-31 00:00:00
,Speak With Me – Control Your Car By Voice,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/30/speakwithme-control-your-car-by-voice/,"I had the opportunity to sit down with Ajay Juneja, the founder of Mountain View based Speak With Me , at Tag Camp this weekend. I had a half hour demo in his car and was completely blown away by what he’s created. You can see pictures of Ajay and his car at my flickr account . What’s so special about his car? He’s layered a proprietary dialog manager, which semantically parses and analyzes data, on top of off-the-shelf speech recognition software, to create one kick ass computer system that is controlled with an array microphone. It allows you to control your car via speech. It was jaw-droppingly impressive. For the demo, Ajay controlled his stereo system verbally, changing songs, picking tracks, controlling volume, etc. The commands he used to do this were in absolutely plain English and varied considerably in structure. For instance, Ajay at one time said “go to track 3”. Another time he said “play for me another one bites the dust”. Later, “I would like to hear wonderful tonight by eric clapton. “louder”. “quieter”. Everything worked. No errors. Perfect. He repeatedly tried to trick the system by asking for a song with the wrong artist, etc. The system simply asked him, in its charmingly computerish voice, whether he wanted to hear the song, or a song by the artist. Ajay then showed me their navigation product, which will integrate into car’s existing nav systems. Drivers will be able to control many aspects of the driving experience verbally once this product is commercially available. I didn’t want to get out of the car. Frankly, I wanted to find a way to steal his car. Robert Scoble saw Ajay’s car months ago at BarCamp. He agreed (verbally) to a non disclosure agreement and couldn’t talk much about it. Now, Ajay’s company has advanced enough that he is talking about many aspects of the product, and giving demo’s, without NDAs in place. Ajay graduated from the computer science program, with a minor in robotics, at Carnegie Mellon University. He also took graduate courses at the language technologies institute (see also the speech to speech product being discussed all over the web today, which is has also been developed at Carnegie Mellon), where this software has been under development for ten years. The original Carnegie Mellon researcher on the technology behind speakwithme is Matthias Denecke, who is now an advisor to Ajay. Speak With Me will not be commercially available until at least late 2007, when it will be built directly into cars (they are negotiating deals now) and available at high end car stereo shops. The car stereo product will be around $400-$600, and the navigation system will be in the $2,500 range. They will also offer additional services. One example – the car’s voice can be a celebrity. Ajay asked me how I’d like to have Paris Hilton, or whoever, interact with me to control my stereo and navigation system. Yep, I’d be up for that.",,2005-10-30 00:00:00
,Real Estate Vertical Search With Trulia,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/30/real-estate-vertical-search-with-trulia/,"Trulia is a  vertical search engine for real estate. Pete Flint and Sami Inkinen, Stanford MBAs, founded Trulia in 2004, and just moved their ten person company into shiny new offices in San Francisco. Trulia is currently angel funded. The site launched a month ago with California listings only. Trulia will be rolling out new states (the next one will be this week) in the near future. Like Oodle, Trulia pulls its content from multiple, distributed sources. In Trulia’s case, its data is indexed from real estate professionals’ websites, where the most detailed information on home listings is located. Trulia often has listings that aren’t included in the MLS, either because the agent hasn’t uploaded the listing yet, or for some new home construction, they never appear in the MLS at all. The site, which is advertiser supported, has excellent integration with Google maps and provides email and RSS notifications of new search results. Another feature that I really like are the statistics. For any given search, Trulia will show statistics on average home prices per bedroom (but for some reason no average across all home listings), average time a home is on the market, average price per square foot, etc. Trulia does not show for sale by owner listings at this time. Their main goal, in addition to providing a rich user experience, is to serve real estate professionals by lowering their marketing costs and driving traffic to their websites. Pete tells me that indexing information from professionals’ sites is not easy – it has to be properly parsed and formatted for re-display on Trulia, and duplicate listings removed (some websites show listings from third party agents).",Trulia,2005-10-30 00:00:00
,Wow! Del.Icio.Us Rolls Out More Stuff,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/29/wow-delicious-rolls-out-more-stuff/,"In addition to the robust and open search functionality released by Del.icio.us earlier this week, there are at least two additional new features that are worth noting. I also have a few more thought on the search function below. Del.icio.us has built a media player directly into the site . If you find a link to a MP3 file, a small icon appears to the left of the bookmark that can be clicked to play the file. Try it out . Tag Bundles are, effectively, tags of tags. This feature existed before, but it is now much easier to create and edit tag bundles with a simple click of tags. I’ve been using the del.icio.us search function a lot over the last few days. For certain searches, del.icio.us has far more relevant results than any other real time engine. The data isn’t necessarily deep, but the top result is super relevant. More on this (possibly) later, but del.icio.us may have just very quietly created the best (real time) search engine on the web. One last thing. Someone pointed out to me recently that delicious.com is now redirecting to del.icio.us. The domain is registered under Joshua’s name. I think it’s a great move to obtain the domain, and I wouldn’t mind a re-brand with the new URL.",del.icio.us,2005-10-29 00:00:00
,Blogniscient V. Memeorandum,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/29/blogniscient-v-memeorandum/,"Ben Ruedlinger’s Blogniscient relaunched today with a completely new look and feel. An old screenshot of the service is here . Blogniscient is a blog news organizer that, like Memeorandum , uses a propreitary algorithm for determining what’s hot in the blogosphere at any given time. Unlike Digg , which creates news items based on user bookmarking and subsequent voting to determine front page items, Blogniscient and Memeorandum are automated. Another similarity: both have hard to remember, and difficult to spell, domain names. :-) Memeorandum has two verticals currently: Politics and Tech . Blogniscient has five: politics, tech, sports, entertainment and business. Blogniscient also has an “all category”, and additional tabs for “top blogs” and “freshest stuff”. Memeorandum does not rank blogs publicly. They include new content on the top right area of the site, and additional new content on the bottom left. Memeorandum also includes older content that has fallen from the main area, on the bottom right of the site. Blogniscient just posts a link and summary of top articles. Memorandum goes two steps further – showing blogs that contribute to the discussion, as well as a permalink for the entire discussion group. For instance, Blogniscient’s new launch is the top story on Memeorandum right now, which you can see by clicking here , even after it’s fallen off as stale news. Memeorandum appears more transparent in their ranking because you can actually see and link to blogs which have contributed to the discussion. Memeorandum also can show news items from major publications like the New York Times, and press releases, as the main news items. Linking blogs are shown in the discussion area. I also find this to be a very useful feature. Taking everything into consideration, I still believe that Memeorandum is a better service. I’ll use Blogniscient too, but Memeorandum has actually changed the way I approach the web – I spend more time on Memeorandum than any other website.",Memeorandum,2005-10-29 00:00:00

,Shadows 1.0,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/28/shadows-20/,"I had an early peak at Shadows while it was still in beta, back in July . Shadows is a Pluck product. Last week, Pluck took the beta tag off of Shadows and released v 1.0 . Dave Panos, Pluck’s CEO, gave me a walk through of the new functionality last night. Shadows is a social bookmarking site with good features, and all of the expected bells and whistles. But the reason I like it so much is that they’ve come up with a really interesting application for all the bookmark data they collect – shadow pages. If you choose to install their toolbar, you can click on “Shadow Page” from any web page and be redirected to that page’s Shadow Page. This page is a collection of metadata gathered from user bookmarks. For instance, here is the Shadow Page for Apple’s iPod Nano . The Shadow Page includes notes from users who have bookmarked the iPod Nano web page, a tag cloud of tags used to describe the page, users who’ve tagged it, etc. A user can choose to make any bookmark private, but any public bookmarks are included on the Shadow Page. It’s a really unique product and a good twist on social bookmarking. Shadows also has set up groups, like this one for Web 2.0. Links are automatically collected here by users who tag pages with “web2.0”. There is also a tab for a general discussion that any user can participate in. The fact that all of this metadata for websites is being collected is not that interesting. What is interesting is that anyone can access this site metadata (and only that site’s metadata) by simply clicking a button in a toolbar. Shadows has been slowly building up a loyal user base, many of which are interested in highly niche content. An example is this Shadow Page on Harry Potter . An entire community has emerged around this page, with users writing their own Harry Potter fiction, thousands of discussion items, etc. As more groups are formed (and users will soon have the ability to create a group on the fly, based on how they tag a page), more of these microcommunities will sprout, generating lots of page views for Shadows.",Shadows,2005-10-28 00:00:00

WaxMail requires a small download and a quick installation with Outlook. From there, all you have to do is click a button to record a voicemail. The sound file is saved as an MP3 and is attached to the email, which can also include text and other attachments. WaxMail is free, although there is a small text advertisement added to the email. For those wishing to exclude the add, WaxMail charges a $29.95 one time fee. We’ve profiled a few companies in this space – vemail , slawesome , and springdoo . They all do things a little differently…and for many people WaxMail will work best. The downside is that it only currently works with Outlook, and I really dislike Outlook. The upside: it’s free, it works incredibly well and it has a very slick interface. Also, I love the fact that files are actually sent as attachments (meaning they can be listened to offline, easily forwarded, etc.) instead of forcing the listener to click on a link. Check out Jason Clarke for additional information. Try it out and send me a voice message at editor@techcrunch.com UPDATE:  Robert Scoble just discovered WaxMail as well and has some ideas on using it for podcasting.",Waxmail,2005-10-26 00:00:00
,Psst…Want In To The Wink Beta?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/26/psstwant-in-to-the-wink-beta/,"Wink is a very interesting new search site that combines traditional search results with del.icio.us and other user generated metadata. We profiled Wink on October 12, 2005 and Michael Tanne, the CEO, gave a demo at our party last week . Wink was also one of the sponsors of our party. Wink is in private beta right now and are dripping in new users a few at a time to test the service. Thousands of people have been waiting weeks to get in. As part of their sponsorship of our party, Wink has agreed to guarantee immediate access to the first 100 people who request a beta account at Wink and write “techcruncher” in the note section. This process is automated – if you don’t receive an immediate invitation you either misspelled “techcruncher” or 100 people have already requested an invite with the code. If you aren’t one of the first 100, they will still make an effort to get you to the top of the list. Michael has requested that I stress that beta testers should be willing to spend some time helping them build out the service. You can do that by tagging results, syncing with your del.icio.us tags, creating search sets and, generally, performing a lot of searches.",Wink,2005-10-26 00:00:00
,First Screen Shots Of Riya,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/26/riya-prepares-to-launch-alpha/,"Riya (formerly Ojos ) will be opening its doors to 10 or so lucky alpha testers tomorrow morning. Riya leverages potent facial and text recognition technology with an intelligent interface to help people make sense of the thousands of untitled and untagged photos that are building up on their hard drives (and on the web). We previously profiled Riya (then Ojos) on August 31, 2005 I went by Riya’s offices today and met with the team to get a look at their product. According to Munjal Shah , Riya’s CEO, I am the first outsider to get a chance to bang on the live product. Given how hot Riya is right now, I consider that a huge honor. The process starts with registration and choosing a privacy setting on your pictures. You then download a client application that uploads photos you choose to include in Riya. The actual uploading takes a while – about 4 hours for each GB of photos. Instead of waiting around, Riya will email you when the process is complete. That’s when the fun starts. In my case about 400 pictures were uploaded. I was presented with a view of facial thumbnails of everyone in my photos. Riya asks that you begin to educate it by telling it who the people are…it then very quickly starts to auto-tag pictures with a surprising level of accuracy. Riya also recognizes text in photos, and lets you select any area of a photo and tag that as well. For instance, you could select just the Eiffel Tower in a photo and tag it as such. Within moments, everything of importance in all of my photos was tagged. And more importantly, it was searchable . It’s an easy step to allow friends to also tag and search your photos (if you choose), and even allow full public search. Linking these two features – massively automated tagging of everything in photos, with search, is compelling to say the least. The folks at Riya call it “tag locally, search globally”. Riya is going to be successful. They have real technology. And, as people use it to tag photos, Riya will create a database of unique attributes of people. Once enough people start using the service, Riya will be able to auto-tag people’s names with less and less training by the user. At that point, why would anyone try a competing service? Riya will have technology (protected by patents) and an incredible network effect as well. Riya plans on having a destination site that will be free, and will OEM their service to other photo services. Sites like flickr can certainly try to duplicate Riya’s service, but unless they move very quickly Riya’s network effect Riya will be insurmountable. In fact, Riya could become so ubiquitous as to actually cause real privacy concerns. One question I asked the team today was – “what if you get so much data on people that I could take a picture of a crowd, upload it to Riya, and instantly have the names of every single person in the crowd?” Apparently, their technology is not that powerful – yet. Riya’s ability to know who’s in a photo is largely based on who you are and the people you are connected to. To fully appreciate Riya you have to see it visually. I’ve posted a few screen shots below of my experience using it earlier today. Get in to the Riya alpha if you can . It’s going to be a popular service.",Riya,2005-10-26 00:00:00
,Google Base To Launch,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/25/google-base-to-launch/,"Reports are out that Google Base will be launching soon, perhaps even today. Dirson has a screen shot up on Flickr and additional images are on Wouter Schutâ€™s blog . Google Base appears to be a service to publish content directly to google and have them host it in a centralized way. If so, this would be going completely against the accelerating trend of decentralized publishing. My prediction: when the dust settles, this will either be largely ignored or universally hated. Centralized content is boring…so much is going on at the edge of the web, why would anyone try to put it all back in the center? Philipp Lenssen has more details, including the text from the screen shot below: UPDATE: Tom Oliveri, Product Marketing Manager at Google, has posted a short note about Google Base on the Google blog: Thanks Anthony .",Google_Base; Google,2005-10-25 00:00:00

Michael also reports more interesting news – that VideoEgg has launched a partnership with Six Apart that allows TypePad users to post video to their blogs using Videoegg technology. Check out Venture Voice’s podcast interview with Mena Trott of Six Apart and VideoEgg co-founder Kevin Sladek  as well. VideoEgg, which is incredibly easy to use with just about any video device, is now directly available to a huge blogging base. My hope is that someone creates a wordpress plugin next.

,Kaboodle Launch: Bookmarking + Wiki,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/25/kaboodle-launch-bookmarking-wiki/,"Kaboodle opened its doors this afternoon for an official launch on Wednesday. I met with Manish Chandra, the CEO, earlier today for a walk through and came away very impressed. In addition to Manish, Kaboodle’s founders include Keiron McCammon and Chetan Pungaliya. Kaboodle is a free social bookmarking service. And it really does take things to the next level in terms of usefulness, particularly for certain types of stuff. For instance, Kaboodle really shines when bookmarking ecommerce content. The first thing to do after registration is add a kaboodle button to your browser. When you click to bookmark content, you are redirected to Kaboodle where you select a “page” (topic). Content is auto-selected, including an image. A click lets you change or add to the content and/or select a new image. Once you’ve added content to a page you can choose to make it public or private, and share it with others. New content can be added to a page from other sites. Each piece of content can be rated by others, and free-text comments can be added. It is an excellent way to collaborate with others in comparing and contrasting related content. In fact, in many ways Kaboodle reminds me of a wiki once the collaboration on a page begins. Coming soon functionality includes page badges, search and RSS for users and pages. I’d also like to see tagging functionality added to pages and individual pieces of content. Om Malik wrote a lengthy post on Kaboodle a few hours ago. In my opinion Manish Chandra and the rest of the team have done a great job rolling this out. They are talking to bloggers and mainstream press simultaneously, and the site is a textbook example of how to walk new users through how the service works. They’ve thought through launch strategy and usability in a very intelligent way.",,2005-10-25 00:00:00
,Annotating Your Web With Stickis,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/24/annotating-your-web-with-stickis/,"In 1999 Eng-Sion Tan launched a company called Third Voice, a browser plug-in that created a sidebar on web pages and allowed surfers to annotate the page by adding their comments. The service quickly devolved into web graffiti and shut it’s doors two years later. Even though Third Voice is gone, the idea had some value. And soon Jean Sini and Marc Meyer will be launching something that has some of the characteristics of Third Voice, but which will not have the same graffiti result. They call it Stickis . Stickis is still in private alpha. I don’t have credentials yet (they are keeping it very quiet and don’t want screen shots on the web), but Marc and Jean came by last week to give me a peak at the service. You can request an alpha invitation on their home page . To be honest, it took me a while to get it. The reason: they’ve built a platform that has at least two or three killer applications and I saw so much in so short a time that I was getting lost. I slowed things down by asking dumb questions and, in the process became pretty fired up about stickis in general. Once you are registered, you can add a “sticki” to any web page with your notes, which can be in the form of text or dragged in images. Every time you return to that page you can pull up your sticki. For lots of sites that I interact with, the ability to keep these notes is very interesting. Notes can be shared with friends or kept private. You can also subscribe to feeds from other sites, and if those feeds have linked to the current site you are visiting that content will also appear in the stickis. For instance, If you were to go to the Sticki site, and you had subscribed to the TechCrunch feed, you would see this post included in the sticki. They’ve also included a master page to manage the content you’ve distributed on various pages, and add feeds and friend’s content. Marc and Jean are in the process of raising an angel round – everything to date has been created on their own dime and with their own time. They’ve been working on it for about a year.",,2005-10-24 00:00:00
,A Second Look At Inform.Com,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/24/a-second-look-at-informcom/,"We hammered on Inform.com last week following their launch and a fluffy article in the New York Times. Inform.com’s goal is to provide a useful news interface – both blog and non-blog – and to show the interconnectedness of all of the content. We had a number of concerns with the service. It’s a full page popup to ensure that they entirely control the user experience. It doesn’t work properly in Firefox. You are limited to reading the content they provide (you can’t add content they haven’t included in the service). The scroll button on the mouse doesn’t work. Etc. I received an email from Julian Steinberg, the project manager at Inform, a few days after my initial post. He offered a point-by-point response to each of my criticisms. We followed up with a phone call today. I am re-printing his email below (with his permission), and I want to point out a few positive aspects of the service as well that I discovered after he walked me through it. This was a reasonable and articulate response to a fairly aggressive post. And other than the scroll wheel funtionality (it doesn’t work), his counterpoints are good ones. Here’s what I learned from the walk through: This is a beta, so thin content is excusable. They do an excellent job of relating content to other content via topics (basically keywords). They do a great job with filtered tagging (searching across multiplie keywords like “miami” and “football”), something no real time search engine does today and which is a really useful way of drilling down into new content. You can also toggle on/off blog and non-blog news. New feature releases over the next couple of months include a video seach and viewing tool, better firefox integration and the ability to add feeds that are not currently already included at Inform. I’m looking forward to all of this.",Inform.com,2005-10-24 00:00:00
,Del.Icio.Us Expands Search Feature,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/24/337/,"Fred Wilson reports that Del.icio.us has extended its existing user-only search to everyone. Previously search was available only if you were logged in to your del.icio.us account. Check it out on any del.icio.us page, including here . Joshua Schachter has not yet written about this on the del.icio.us blog . Search functionality has also been expanded. In addition to showing your own results in addition to everyone else’s, you can search using “and” (such as apples and oranges) to drill down into more relevant results. Results are returned if the query term is contained withint the title of the bookmark and/or within tags. UPDATE : Per Joshua’s comments below (the founder of del.icio.us), del.icio.us comments are also searched. You can use “tag:tagname” to just search tags. If you are going to do multiple tag search, AND must be capitalized. I like the extended functionality a lot.

,Thank You For Coming To Our Party,https://techcrunch.com/2005/10/22/thank-you-for-coming-to-our-party/,"I believe we had as many as 200 people here last night for TechCrunch Meetup #3 . The last of the guests left at 4 am. Thank you to everyone who came and everyone who tried to attend via festoon. Scott Beale took my favorite picture of the event. Here’s my second favorite : Kevin Burton hard at work on TailRank – using my oven as a desk. Thanks to our very generous sponsors we were able to cater the event and provide t-shirts for everyone. You can also purchase a tshirt directly from Zazzle. There were too many demos but they were all excellent . It was exciting to see the first public view of Sphere, and meet some of the entrepreneurs behind the other companies as well. Thank you to everyone who took the time to show us their products. Dave Winer gave a rousing keynote that got everyone fired up. People are calling it the Flickr of keynotes . The always cool Marc Canter and his wife were in costume (picture also shows Keith Teare). Robert Scoble was here for hours and barely left the back room where we were showing raw demos of the really young companies, including edgeio . VCs were roaming the party, looking for the next great investment. Google, Yahoo and ebay all had product managers, developers and business development people quietly talking to entrepreneurs. Scott Beale, Tara Hunt and others were taking pictures of everyone and everything (Flickr tag for your photos is “techcrunch” – please post them!). It was Web 2.0 perfection. The only problem was the whole festoon remote participation idea didn’t work out at all. People couldn’t see or hear anything. Someone created a very funny festoon image and defaced the wiki this morning. Instead of deleting it, we kept it up . That kind of creativity shouldn’t be deleted. We’ll get it right next time. :-) Then there was the whole keg situation. We never did get the damn thing to produce beer, even after a number of geeks and ex-bartenders went to work on it . Clearly we didn’t have the right kind of geeks at the event (via Marc Brown ). The best thing about these parties is that we all get the chance to get to know each other a little bit better, and intensely cross-pollinate ideas. I am keeping a running directory below of blog posts and pictures from the event. Please email me if you’ve written about it with the link.

Ma.gnolia describes itself as “Found is the New Search” and “Social Bookmarking to build an information community online”, adding: They promise a beta in December 2005. I’m skeptical of companies that continue to launch with these domain name abominations (dropping vowels, using random ccTLDs and lots of extra dots), but if the service rocks, I will forgive all.

,Windows Live Email Service,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/25/windows-live-email-service/,"Domains.Live.com is a free new email service offered by Microsoft. It’s a simple but very useful tool. And, like Office Live , it is disruptive to the existing domain name registrar market (are they even paying attention?). So the basic service is this: Microsoft will host email and instant messaging for you in a domain you own. More details on the Custom Domains blog . Here are my thoughts: First of all, this is great. Until now, generally only domain name registrars offered this kind of service, and it was both costly and had a very web 1.0 interface. Second, when I look at services like this and Office Live, it seems to me that the industry that needs to be most concerned are the domain name registrars. Many of the services Microsoft is offereing for free are the types of things that reigstrars charge for today. Microsoft is starting to create really impressive productity tools for the small business. And they aren’t charging for these tools. Competitors need to watch out.

,Wink Launches,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/22/wink-launches/,"The Wink user-enhanced search engine, in private beta for the last few months, launches Thursday morning to the world. Wink has evolved substantially since my October 12, 2005 review . Wink is, at its core, a combination of traditional search with feature-rich social bookmarking. Bookmarked/tagged results appear above normal search. Search results can be bookmarked, tagged and rated from Wink. The same functionality is available via a bookmarklet that works with Firefox, Safari and IE. As a twist, users can also block “bad” pages. Lots of functional Ajax is built into the interface. Users can easily browse tag results (either their own, or all users). There are three key additional features. First, Wink has added two way synchronization with del.icio.us bookmarks. And they’ve added a “Keep Sync’d” feature that, as the name implies, maintains a constant one or two-way syncronization with del.icio.us. No word on whether they will add in other social bookmarking services over time or not. Second, Wink allows the creation of “collections”, which is a tag group (tags of tags). Collections are controlled by one user but can be shared with anyone. Third, and this feature really appeals to me, Wink has added a “Wink Answers” tab to search results. The text is a wiki – meaning anyone can edit it. For queries that have complicated results, a number of options appear. A lot of data has been pre-populated, and I believe this will be a popular feature. Like Wikipedia, it begs for user interaction, but with a lower intimidation factor. Wink is also finalizing a nice blog widget that includes additional links (that point only to bookmarks created by the blogger). See here for an example. I have not had the opportunity to test this myself yet, but it looks interesting. Congratulations to Founder Michael Tanne and the entire Wink team.",Wink,2005-12-22 00:00:00

Like Om says, it’s a must-have product to aid the browsing experience. And I see a business model here, too. Hyperwords gives users a number of choices whenever a piece of text is selected. The options simply pop up – right click functionality remains unchanged. Options include searching various engines, looking up text in wikipedia and dictionary.com, emailing text, searching on Google Maps, translation, and searching on Amazon and other commerce sites. The search and commerce traffic will generate revenue (my guess is a dollar or so per year per active user). The translation service is incredibly useful.

They’ve solved a lot of the problems associated with storage away from the network, and has both an online and a desktop interface.

In some ways it’s a standard bookmarking site, but at this point lacks most of the advanced features of Del.icio.us, Shadows, Wink, etc. But Browsr does have one feature that is interesting. Bookmarks are categorized, and others can rate the usefullness of the bookmark. Browsr then creates a home page directory of the most popular categories and the highest ranked bookmarks within each category. The result is a very nice directory. I like products that take aggregated user data and do something interesting with it. In an indirect way, this reminds me of memeorandum, digg and other useful services that do the same.

TalkDigger queries major blog (and other) search engines on a given URL and returns relevant results.  Since all of the search engines vary in their results, this is the quickest way to see everything. Enhancements include more search results, more search engines, pagerank for each result, and more.

This will not only hurt the NewsGators and Attensas of the RSS space (those that have Outlook plugins to display RSS feeds). It will also impact Bloglines and others as users inevitably move their reading habits to the email client. The ability to drag stories right into subject folders, that may or may not contain emails as well, is just too useful to ignore (and that’s why I liked Yahoo’s integration of RSS with email so much a few weeks ago). Robert Scoble also wrote about this, and brings up a very important point. Users want RSS in many different ways (mobile, web when they are away from their home computer, etc.). Syncronization is extremely important and this may be the niche that allows existing players to survive.

,Gravee Takes A New Approach To Search,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/21/gravee-takes-a-new-approach-to-search/,"Gravee soft launched tonight. It has an interesting business model. In addition to pulling in search results from Google, MSN and Yahoo (Alexa coming soon), Gravee also allows publishers to claim their site and, theoretically, get a piece of Gravee’s revenue. Here’s how it works : Gravee also shares up to 35% of revenue with publisers that join their affiliate program and place their search box on their site. This will be an interesting way of driving traffic to their site. Site claiming is done via whois information – meaning you must be in control of your domain name to claim the blog. Another way for them to accomplish this would be to ask the site owner to put a piece of code on her/his site, which I imagine they will add at some point.",,2005-12-21 00:00:00

It’s a competitor to Kleiner-backed Zazzle , and CafePress – basically they let you set up shop and sell items with your logo on it. As with all of these services, they do all the hard work – producing and shipping the item, and collecting the money. All the seller has to do is market the shop, set prices and collect their share of the money. GoodStorm was founded by Yobie Benjamin and August Capital’s Andy Rappaport in October and launched on December 14, 2005 (there are good pictures of the team at that link as well). Their business model is designed to cater specifically to nonprofits. They keep only 30% of the profits on a sale (giving the rest to the seller), and also donate a portion of profits to charity. Like I said, it’s hard not to like this company. Currently they are working with sellers one-one-one, but will eventually launch a self service store creator. The company is built on the Drupal open source content management system. GoodStorm says they will be donating chunks of code back to the project as well.

,"Flock Says ""Enough""",https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/21/flock-says-enough/,"Flock has gotten a lot of criticism lately. The reason for this particular round of naysaying is the launch of the impressive Performancing Firefox plugin that allows extremely easy blogging, from Firefox, for WordPress, MovableType or Blogger. Performancing is getting extremely good reviews from top bloggers like Paul Kedrosky , Om Malik and Steve Rubel . But the attacks didn’t start with the release of Performancing. They go way back.  Flock even has its own hate blog (flocksucks.wordpress.com)  (although this one substitutes common cruelty for actual insight and humor). My guess is Flock is suffering from a bit of backlash over its early hype. And my further guess is that Flock, backed by an impressive group of founders and investors, has a few massive tricks up its sleeve that will be announced (or leak out) sometime soon. Until now Flock has done little to fuel all the hype, and have likewise refrained from responding to the criticism. Tonight, however, Flock’s Chris Messina , supported by CEO Bart Decrem , takes issue with some of the bashing. I like this post, and not just because Chris at one point says “jack-in-the-box assclown” or calls web surfing with Firefox extensions “Firefox and Duct tape”.  Chris gives a passionate, if not entirely fact laden, speach on what the hell they are trying to accomplish over at Flock. My last post on Flock, covering its beta launch, is here .

,Bubbleshare – Best Photo Service Yet?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/20/bubbleshare-best-photo-service-yet/,"Toronto-based online photo sharing BubbleShare is just wonderful, and ridiculously easy to use. Their interface team deserves a gold star or something, because I don’t think I’ve ever used a site’s full functionality without consulting a single FAQ or other instruction. BubbleShare allows users to upload photos without registration (this isn’t really a trick either – later registration is absolutely bare bones). There is a tour linked from the home page, but you really don’t need it – just start uploading photos and you’ll get how it works (they use the Flash 8 upload feature for photo sharing). Things are album based. The free service allows users to create albums of up to 100 photos each, with a permanent URL for sharing.  Photos can be dragged and dropped to change the order, resized and a voice comment can be added. Comments are available for visitors as well as an RSS feed. Another key BubbleShare feature that many photo sites don’t have is a multi-uploader tool that allows user to upload many photos at once. The only thing that BubbleShare is missing is photo tagging and tag search. BubbleShare is now my second-favorite Canadian web 2.0 company. :-) Brian Benzinger has more .",,2005-12-20 00:00:00

That was before Google released their desktop widget API and favoor launched. And now we have a developer release of a new ajax desktop called Pageflakes (available only in IE). Pageflakes has a number of features – rss reading, email checking, note taking, searching, etc. It also has a developer API to allow third party module-creation. Given that Microsoft and Google have this feature, it is a must have to even get in the game. Pageflakes says it is easier to develop modules for their site than for Microst Live or Google – Developers can use MS Visual Studio and they support ASP.NET and Atlas (modules can also be build using PJP or JSP). Of course, overcoming the user loyalty of Netvibes (now a significant source of TechCrunch daily traffic) and the network power of Microsoft and Google will be very difficult.

Tonight, Founder and CEO Munjal Shah finally addressed the acquisition rumors around Riya on his blog, stating flatly that Riya continues as an independent company: Robert Scoble just wrote about this as well, admitting that Microsoft took a look at Riya (passing on the price), and expressing his hope that they’ll take another look now that the Google deal has fallen through. Either way, I’m just looking forward to the product finally shipping. Munjal says that will be at Demo in February. And as an interesting side discussion, Peter Rip , a Riya investor (and a friend of mine) takes us all down a notch (TechCrunch is specifically mentioned) saying “Every report was factually incorrect at the time it was printed.  I did not see one accurate characterization of any discussions Riya.com may or may not have had.” Ouch. But this can’t be entirely correct – Robert has confirmed in his blog that Microsoft met with Riya and passed on the deal.

I wrote in a recent post (no. 9) that I’d like to see someting like this be built. Don’t look so much at the current execution of Kritx and judge them too quickly – think about the idea that they are trying to exploit. There are millions of passionate user reviews on blogs today of everything you can think of – movies, music, books, resaurants, etc. Just do a technorati search for “review” and whatever you are looking for. Of course, initiatives to better organize blog data, like structured blogging and microformats , will make this data even easier to index and present to users. kritX is combinging blog reviews and microformats with a vertical search engine to present these edge reviews to users. It has a long way to go. Authors must use microformats and tell kritX that they want their posts included (neither of these things are really necessary). But it is a good idea that can grow into something incredible. All the data is just sitting out there on the open internet, ready to be harvested. See also Blogcritics , who do something similar (although they do not require microformats, they do require author registration at the site).

,Technorati Explore Smells Like Memeorandum,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/14/technorati-explore-smells-like-memeorandum/,"Whoa. Niall Kennedy nonchalantly wrote earlier today about Technorati’s version of Google Labs, called Technorati Kitchen . It’s where Technorati is putting it’s not-fully-baked beta products. There’s only one project there now, and it’s called “ Explore “. Explore sure looks a like it was inspired by Memeorandum : Explore is broken out into multiple categories, including Business, Fashion, Gadgets, Tech and many more. A quick look at Tech shows a very Memeorandum-like interface . Posts are listed according to links in (just like Memeorandum), and links are clustered underneath the headline (just like Memeorandum). Technorati Explore is a really interesting way to see how popular blog conversations are clustering (just like Memeorandum). Here’s what Explore doesn’t do as well as Memeorandum: It’s nowhere near as real-time as Memeorandum (although Technorati is indexing the entire blogosphere whereas Memeorandum only indexes a few thousand blogs).  Also, Memeorandum is advanced enough to cluster related items even when they don’t necessarily link to eachother – Technorati doesn’t do this. Finally, Memeorandum includes news items (NYT, etc.) and press releases as headlines, which Technorati isn’t doing. Here’s what it does better than Memeorandum: It works for any tag – just search on http://kitchen.technorati.com/explore/%5BTAGNAME%5D , whereas Memeorandum today only has sites for politics and technology. Also, Technorati automatically includes all blogs in the conversaiton, whereas Memeorandum only includes its few thousand indexed blogs. With Technorati, even the smaller bloggers can get in on the conversation. This is not as addictive as Memeorandum.

The desktop was launched on July 25 and can be accessed at google.com/ig or by clicking on “Personalized Home” on the Google main site. As reported by Google Blogoscoped , Google has released a very simple developer API to allow anyone to create and host modules that people can add to their Google homepage. The API is available here . A module is an XML file and can be an extremely simple piece of code. Most of the modules have been created by Google employees at this point. The directory of available modules is here . I’ve stated before that opening up the API and allowing third party modules is a great idea for just about every web 2.0 product, and ajax desktops are no exception. Microsoft did this with Live.com (directory is at microsoftgadgets.com ), and has a ton of third party created widgets available. Google’s home page has evolved significantly since July. In addition to news and RSS modules, users have the option of pulling in gmail links, weather, etc. It’s a useful application.

These new Flash applications are always visually stunning, even if they are not as fast as their Ajax counterparts. GritWire is no exception – its well designed. The RSS reader is functional but not spectacular. There are OPML import options and a feed search, but images are not shown in the reader and most (all?) formatting is also stripped out. There are, however, a number of additional features, including a podcast player, alerts (I can’t seem to make this work) and a “wiki” feature. The wiki is a basic text box that can be edited by you and, I assume, your friends. It’s a nice collaboration tool (I want something like this wiki on my desktop for easy group working). The Gritwire blog is here . Gritwire is hosting a big open bar launch party tonight at a San Francisco bar called  The Cellar – in my opinion this was a bad idea. Expensive launch parties are very Web 1.0.  Instead of throwing a party (and spending all your time asking everyone to attend), you should have just rented a room and demo’d the product for bloggers and other journalists all day. Very few people who show up for the free booze will give a damn about your product. I did, however, have a great conversation with Steven Cohen about Gritwire at the Pluck get together this evening.

,Tagworld Launches Music. The War Begins.,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/12/tagworld-launches-music-the-war-begins/,"Over the weekend TagWorld , a young, self-funded startup in Santa Monica that’s all of a month old, launched a music product that is turning heads. TagWorld is targeting the MySpace crowd – generally people under 25, who all want a blogging/home page presence on the web. Sites like MySpace, FaceBook and Xanga are generating a truly massive number of page views – MySpace and FaceBook each rival Google in page views (although they don’t approach the reach). The reason?  These users spend most of their day on these sites, updating their sites and clicking on friends. TagWorld already had an impressive feature set that includes a GB of storage and great ajax tools for creating a site. And, as the name implies, tagging of everything. The new music functionality is a full generation ahead of MySpace and others. Bands can upload a GB of music  and have a number of DRM options to control distrubution. Users can mix this music into their own media player and can upload their own music (and other files, like photos and movies) as well. They can create customized music playlists, store the music on TagWorld and have access to it anywhere they can get online. Users can also set up playlists that others can listen to when they visit the user’s website. All of this requires nothing but the ability to click on the music and drag the music player modue onto their site. No HTML or other technical skills are needed. Can TagWorld take on MySpace and become the King of Social Networks 3.0 ? Yeah, I think they will. For a number of reasons. First, the founders, Fred Krueger and Evan Rifkin, have done a great job getting top bands to start using the platform. Check out the TagWorld pages for Death Cab For Cutie , The Shins and The Postal Service . Second, TagWorld has 160,000+ users after just a month of being live. The “in” crowd is starting to notice. Third, I think the teenager/student social network doesn’t have the same lock-in that, say, ebay has. TagWorld’s target users are fickle and don’t want to be considered mainstream. They’ll try new things and if the functionality is there, they’ll stay. And this target market is constantly renewing itself as children become teenagers (new customers) and young adults move on to more professional tools (customers leave). So, in a nutshell, I’m bullish on TagWorld. And some of these features quite frankly appeal to a much larger audience than teenagers and young adults. The market for an online music locker with a portable player is wide open. TagWorld can take this market.",Tagworld; MySpace,2005-12-12 00:00:00

OpinMind claims to index 1.7 million blogs today. Type in a search engine-like query (or click on popular searches like “ beer “) and see a result categorized into “positive” and “negative” for your query. OpinMind tries to determine whether a blog is positive or negative on the item you’ve entered based on surrounding context. And you can do a faceoff by typing two queries with a “vs.” between them. Try Google vs. Yahoo (Google nudges out Yahoo with a 73% v. 55% approval rating – I wonder if that will change much over time) . Or Democrats vs. Republicans (Democrats win with a 42% approval rating v. 27% for Republicans). Statistically relevant? Not even close. Fun? Totally. As OpinMind starts tracking more blogs over a longer time, I’d love to be able to track how opinions on a given topic evolve. And while it may be difficult to build a business around OpinMind (Matt Marshall says “ Opinmind not ready for prime time “), I like tools that do interesting things with edge-based content. Maybe OpinMind, like Memeorandum, will get people thinking about new ways to do interesting things with blog and other edge content.

,Writely Is Kicking A**,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/10/writely-is-kicking-a/,"Writely ( profiled earlier ) continues to lead the pack in online ajax word products. Writely has had great features from day 1: import and export into Word format, embedded images, a wysiwyg editor, drag and drop functionality, sharing with others, and tagging of documents. They are also rolling out new features regularly and annoucing them on the Writely blog .  A few features that I’ve noticed recently: The ability to create PDFs directly from writely is a really useful tool that you cannot do with Word (unless you’ve separately purchased or have otherwise obtained the PDF software). Writely is no longer a toy – it is fast becoming a legitimate alternative to Word. Here’s what I’d like to see next – a quick rollout of other office applications, starting with Excel and Power Point. The rumor is that Writely is courting venture capital money now and is being very well received.

Yahoo has acquired Del.icio.us , which has approximately 300,000 users: Competition is such a wonderful thing. Yahoo, in addition to launching a flurry of new products in the last few months (and the pace seems to be accelerating), now owns the two most important tagging properties on the web – flickr and del.icio.us.

,Yahoo Answers Launches,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/08/yahoo-answers-launches/,"Yahoo Answers launched this morning . The service allows any Yahoo user to ask any question and get answers and advice from other Yahoo users. The community picks the “best” answer, and everything is archived for search. There is a product tour available here . A similr service, Wondir , launched earlier this year. Yahoo Answers is taking a different (and more web 2.0) approach than Google Answers , which charges for answers and relies on paid experts. To incentivize users, Yahoo is creating a points system based on quality and quantity of participation. There are a number of interesting features built in, including spam flags and RSS feeds for every question. I only have one complaint. Tagging. Yahoo owns one of the best tagging sites out there – Flickr. And yet they continue to stumble on the tagging issue when launching new products. Shoposphere , for instance, desperately needs tagging (it will be added early next year). In this case, Yahoo Answers requries you to categorize your question under a single pre-defined category, and then choose further pre-defined sub categories. While this certainly helps structure the data for easier search, it isn’t very useful to the publisher. It would be so much easier if, like Flickr, the person asking the question could tag it with a few descriptive terms. They have an incentive to get it right, and Yahoo would quickly have rich enough data to create a virtual category on the fly as users search or browse through the listings. Making this a free, community-driven service takes it way beyond Google answers. Take the next step:  ditch this impossible to maintain category system and move to tagging and dynamic, on-the-fly taxonomy.",Wondir; Yahoo,2005-12-08 00:00:00

As more office applications move online, JotSpot Tracker joins NumSum and the open-source TrimSpreadsheet in the spreadsheet space. While Jotspot Tracker is clearly the most polished of the three, funcionality is very limited and the small visable area leaves a lot to be desired. Nonetheless, this is an excellent way to collaborate on simpler, smaller spreadsheets and bypass the hassle of email and chaotic version numbers. And the inport function was flawless.

It’s an interesting column discussing the rise of blogs as “journalists” and the usefullness of blog aggregators in filtering out the most important writing. While I agree with the trend that Lee Gomes is highlighting, I also think there is something even bigger going on. I agree with Dave Winer when he says : Bloggers take friction out of the news reporting process. No editors are around to slow down the process. There are also no fact checkers, which can cause problems. However, the blogosphere tends to correct for this, and, as an ecosystem, I’d wager the blogosphere gets more things right than journalists. Anyway, it is an interesting article. Lee Gomes is one of the guys who gets it, obviously. And I just bought every print copy of the ‘Journal at the local newsstand. :-)",,2005-12-07 00:00:00

In addition to road maps and satellite views, Microsoft is beginning to integrate “birds eye” views, which are photos with significantly more detail than satellite pictures alone (see above screenshot). In addition, driving directions will be more fully integrated into the service. This is a significant improvement on the existing service as well as a rebranding exercise. I’m still a big fan of Yahoo’s flash-based mapping service . The multi-point directions are absolutely a must have, and the constantly updating permalink saves a couple of steps when sharing a map.

,Is Feedburner Pushing The Envelope On Trust?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/07/is-feedburner-pushing-the-envelope-on-trust/,"I’m a big fan of FeedBurner and write about them often. I’m also a “pro” subscriber now and pay the $5/month for that service, which I think is more than fair given how much value they add. I like having the insight into RSS analytics, and FeedBurner has never broken on me. I also consider many of the Feedburner guys friends. Even Dick Costolo , the CEO, has helped me personally with some issues in the past. In short, I support Feedburner. Yesterday Feeburner announced some new features on the RSS Feed landing page that are designed to make the user experience a step better than before. The functionality includes storing user preferences for RSS subscriptions, a cleaner layout, and a preview feature for podcasts and videocasts. All good stuff. Frank Gruber writes about this on his blog as well in glowing terms, and in general I agree with him – these are nice features. In looking at the new feed landing page I noticed something that I hadn’t noticed before. An advertisement. It’s just a single line of text – “Download a Free Trial of FeedDemon 1.5”, with a link that begins a download of FeedDemon. I don’t know if it was there before or if this is a recent addition, but I don’t like it. This page should be all about getting new subscribers to the publisher’s feed, not generating revenue for Feedburner. And particularly if the publisher is a paying “pro” member. It’s just one ad now, but this is a slippery slope. Publishers invest a lot when they decide to go with Feedburner – they turn their feed URL over to them and it’s not trivial to switch away. Feedburner, perhaps more than most web 2.0 companies, needs to be very careful with trust issues.",FeedBurner,2005-12-07 00:00:00
,More Video Tools – Grouper V2.0 Rocks,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/06/more-video-tools-grouper-v20-rocks/,"As I continue my journey to find the flickr of videos , I may have found the (near) perfect product – version 2 of Grouper which launches tonight. Grouper is only available for windows and requires a download. But it’s worth it. The product is currently free and allows unlimited uploads of photos and video. Each piece of content can be shared with the public, kept private or shared just with a select group of people. The publisher can also tag content for easy search/find later. And RSS feeds are availble for tags and publishers. A key feature is the ability to create your own “Groovies”, or movies. This is a set of tools which allows users to mash up various video clips, photos and music/audio, along with title pages. These basic tools, all free, give users the power to create really cool videos on the fly and share them with others. Based on the name, I suspected that Grouper was saving them in a proprietary format that could only be viewed on their website or via their client, but there is an option to download and share these files in WMV format. This is absolutely awesome. I feel as though I’ve only touched the surfact of Grouper, and I’m going to continue to test the product. They just may have set the new standard for video sharing on the web (at least for the windows platform).",,2005-12-06 00:00:00

I am calling this a “re-launch” because the changes are significant and affect the core platform of the site. The most significant change is that Inform is no longer operating within a “pop-up”, a process that allowed them to use Ajax functionality but avoid some of the drawbacks like lack of a “back button” feature. Inform now operates cleanly, without popups, in both Internet Explorer and Firefox. This change alone makes Inform a much more interesting and useful service. Other significant changes include the addition of audio and video content to the site, a subject filter that offers related content and which works quite well, and the addition of RSS feeds for search results. Finally, the “top channels” tab now allows drill down into sub-topics, which were not available before. Overall, Inform is an excellent resource and continues to improve dramatically. They have not yet added  a feature to allow users to add non-included news source RSS feeds, but that is on the roadmap and will be released soon. My previous profiles of Inform are here and here .",,2005-12-05 00:00:00

One of the most interesting companies to launch in this space is New York based Boltfolio . Until recently, Boltfolio was unknown to me. What I like best about Boltfolio is that they have unlimited storage and allow uploading of virtually any media file – photos, video and audio. Users should not have to go to multiple sites to upload different kinds of content. They incorporate tagging to assist with search, and also have blogging and other tools to allow users to share content. They also allow for private and public settings on each piece of content. This is another worthy addition to the exploding ranks of media storage and playback.

,Glide Effortless Is Too Much Effort,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/05/glide-effortless-is-too-much-effort/,"Glide Effortless is a service that will help you upload and share just about any type of file – photos, MP3 files, video clips and even Word, PowerPoint or PDF documents. A New York Times article by David Pogue talks about the service in mostly glowing prose: I spent some considerable time this evening trying to get my arms around this rather large project, but gave up before I was even able to finish registration. The home page is a complete mess. This is the first impression a company gives to new potential customers, and Glide decided to pack everything in with 2,604 total words . It’s a damn magnum opus that describes everything Glide was, is and will become, without ever really getting to the point. Registration is a train wreck. There is a free account option, but every registration requires a full name and home address. I entered that, but gave up when it required a credit card to be put on file, even though I was just trying to test the free account. I understand that Glide wants “real” customers since even the free account comes with 150 mb of storage, but this was just too much to ask of a new customer. I sighed, left the computer and drank a glass of wine. I decided to try again. I re-started registration, but the “techcrunch” username was now “taken” due to my previous attempt. And there is no way to resume my previous registration. Requesting a password reset failed. The name was reserved but wasn’t an active account. I could try again with a different user name, but honestly, since 99% of users will also have given up after seeing the home page design and refusing to give up all of this personal information, what’s the point? Glide “Effortless” is just too much effort. If anyone has gone to the effort of getting it up and running, please let me know if it was worth it.",,2005-12-05 00:00:00

,Oboe'S Web Music Locker,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/02/oboes-web-music-locker/,"I begged for this in a post last week about companies I’d like to profile that don’t exist yet (no. 1 – “better and cheaper online storage”). MP3Tunes nailed it with a product suite called Oboe. Oboe offers unlimited online storage of music for $40/year. A free version of the product is also available, although it has extremely limited functionality (no online storage, for example). I’ve registered and have paid for the premium product. Music syncing is accomplished via a downloaded application (windown, mac and linux), and it is going to take forever. I have somewhere around 10,000 songs – and they upload at a rate of 200 songs per hour. That means I’ll be uploading for about 50 hours. Once the songs are uploaded, I’ll write more about how Oboe works. The site promises that users will be able to create and edit playlists, stream music at 128k, and even stream directly through itunes. Supported formats include MP3, MP4, M4A, M4P, AAC, WMA, OGG, AIF, AIFF and MIDI. One feature that is not clearly addressed in the FAQs is whether or not users will be able to download music back to their hard drive (in the event they’ve lost the data locally, for example). The FAQs do state, however, “Just a few mouse clicks will ensure you never lose your music. You can even load it to your other computer with no hassle!” .There are obvious pirating issues with allowing this, as anyone with borrowed or stolen account credentials could download the music. MP3Tunes is a Michael Robertson company, who was the founder of MP3.com. Oboe is his latest attempt at allowing users to access their music online. Previously, MP3.com offered a service called Beam-It which allowed users to verify that they owned a cd by inserting it into their computer, and were subsequently able to access that music directly from the web. MP3Tunes is hoping to avoid the fate of Beam-It by acting as a service provider only and assuming that users legally own the music they upload. The Digital Millenium Copyright Act provides limitations on service provider liability “with respect to information residing, at direction of a user, on a system or network that the service provider controls or operates”. I hope they win this one. Via Brad Hill . UPDATE: I left the syncer on all night. Everything crashed, nothing has uploaded yet. Uh oh. UPDATE: I am completely unable to actually upload any files whatsoever. Giving up. UPDATE : I received an email from Michael Robertson…Oboe is trying to determine the error.

CastingWords is not live yet, although they have a landing page up with some limited search capabilities and an email address for inquiries. Eric spoke with the company and gathered addtional information – apparently they are leveraging Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to produce human-created transcriptions (with software cleanup) of podcasts. This is a space I’ve been watching, as companies race to provide either human-created or automated solutions. I was excited by a Wired article on November 30 that discussed two companies, Podzinger and blinkx , that are attempting to automatically scan and transcribe podcasts.

Like Wink , Jookster is aiming to provide more relevant search results by putting user-generated bookmarked links above normal results. Unlike Wink, which allows users to add significant metadata to bookmarked pages (tags and reviews), Jookster determines relevance of bookmarked queries solely based on a keyword analysis of content on the bookmarked page. Any web page may be bookmarked, or “Jooked” by users. No additional metadata is requested at the time of bookmarking. These results are shows above normal search results on Jooked. A key part of the service is associating with friends. When you perform a search, you have the option of determining who’s bookmarks are also included – just you, friends of friends, one more level out, etc. The Jookster idea is great, but the lack of metadata associated with the bookmarks (particularly tags) means it will not return results nearly as relevant as Wink results.

I wrote about Meebo back in September, and the passionate user comments to that post illustrate the popularity of these services. Gtalkr is taking a different approach by focusing just on Gtalk, and adding in additional features to, I assume, get users to use it more as a home page or dashboard. Gmail emails are pulled in as well as Yahoo maps (Google maps doesn’t have a flash API, Yahoo does). Gtalkr also plans on pulling in addtiional services, such as del.icio.us and flickr. Independent Flash developers can create these extensions as well. It’s a useful tool, and like most flash applications I see, very well designed.

,Rss Is Now Integrated Into Yahoo Mail And Alerts,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/29/rss-is-now-integrated-into-yahoo-mail-and-alerts/,"Yahoo gathered a small group of bloggers, press and others at Sauce in San Francisco tonight to announce the launch of two new RSS products. They have integrated an RSS reader directly into Yahoo Mail Beta, and are expanding Alerts to include RSS feeds. These are significant new products, aimed squarely at new and mainstream RSS users. The service is not live as of the time I am posting this. I’ve added a screen shot picture from the live demo. Yahoo has deeply integrated RSS into the Yahoo Mail beta experience. Directly below the email folders are “RSS folders”. Clicking on the top folder show all posts in a “river of news” format, meaning all posts for all subscribed feeds are listed in the order they have appeared in feeds. Each feed also has its own folder, allowing the user to read feeds individually (more like bloglines). A post from any feed is treated exactly like an email – any post can be forwarded as an email or dragged into a folder and saved. All of the great AJAX functionality already working in Yahoo’s Mail beta works with the new RSS functionality as well. Adding feeds is straightforward – include the feed URL or choose from a number of popular feeds. Yahoo users can now use Yahoo Alerts to be notified whenever RSS feeds update.  Alerts, which include a summary of the updated content, can be configured to be sent via sms, email and/or messenger. This is a great way to monitor small groups of important feeds. Yahoo clearly took the lead for best email application this evening. The ability to “pop in” other email accounts, the ajax functionality and, now, the integrated RSS reader are absolutely stunning features. John Furrier was at the event tonight as well, and as usual has an exclusive podcast . UPDATE: RSS in Yahoo Mail is now fully live. As Jeff Clavier says, My Yahoo and Yahoo Mail syncronize feeds – a long list in email doesn’t work so well in My Yahoo. I spoke to Scott Gatz at Yahoo about this earlier this evening and he says they’ll find a fix for it. There are a few other features which still need to be added, but Yahoo Mail is just an incredibly awesome product.",Yahoo,2005-11-29 00:00:00

,23 Is Too Much Like Flickr,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/27/23-is-too-much-like-flickr/,"23 is a lot like flickr. Almost a clone, even down to the UI and feature comparisons. The service is free, for up to 15 MB of uploading a month. 29 EUR gets you an unlimited bandwidth account. The things I like best about Flickr right now are the “sets” (23 calls them albums) and the uploader tool which takes the pain out of uploading many pictures at once. 23 needs a similar tool. As to whether another photo sharing site can take reasonable market share now that Flickr is so entrenched – Sure. Maybe. This is still a massive growth market, and since 23 is located in Europe they will have an easier time getting users there, where Flickr does not have the market penetration. Greg Yardley has more on 23.",,2005-11-27 00:00:00
,Intuit'S Zipingo Joins Local Business Review Sites,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/27/intuits-zipingo-joins-local-business-review-sites/,"Zipingo joins the ranks of local business review and ranking services such as Yelp , Judy’s Book (which just raised $8 million from Mobius Venture Capital, Ignition Partners and Ackerley Partners) and idealab’s Insider Pages . Like the other sites, Zipingo aims to pair yellow page-like contact information for local businesses with user reviews. It was created (and owned) by Intuit. Since all of these sites are well done, have similar feature sets and have financial backing, it will be very hard for any of them to gain enough critical mass to dominate the market. This is certainly an attactive space (combining local advertising with the potential for premium listings). However, it’s my belief that a single, open API (in and out) yellow page service, with consumer ratings, could dominate this market very quickly. As great as these services are, they rely on centralized content and getting users to come to them to both write reviews and find a business. An open service could have an easy way for businesses to insert their listings (and pay for enhancement), and anyone could take the data via an API (enhancing the network effect many fold). I wrote about this very briefly last week in a post about companies that I’d like to profile but don’t exist yet (no. 7 on the list). Back to Zipingo and the other related services, if there are any dedicated users who’s seen a unique feature or have noticed heavy user participation, please ping me.",Yelp; Riffs; InsiderPages,2005-11-27 00:00:00

,"Root.Net'S ""Lead"" Market",https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/25/rootnets-lead-market/,"I’m intruiged by Seth Goldstein’s Root.net , the first commercial application of the Attention Trust platform (see my Attention Trust posts here and here ). Seth wrote a lengthy and descriptive post outlining the service for all participants on Transparent Bundles . The core service leverages the Attention Trust Recorder, which can be installed by an internet user (currently firefox only). Root.net calls users “consumers”. The recorder tracks everything you do with your browser (it can be turned off at will, and root.net allows deletion of data you’ve recorded that you want to remove). As a consumer you get two primary benefits – the ability to see your own data (see screen shot), and the ability to trade your data to other parties for some benefit – like more targeted advertising that you will actually find useful. This is something John Battelle writes about extensively in his book , by the way. Publishers can also use the root.net system to generate leads, which can be sold to advertisers. Root.net also has anticipated arbitrage players, which they call “investors”, who will purchase leads from publishers and sell them to advertisers. The goal, of course, is to create a more liquid market. I understand at least part of how it is intended to work. An internet user clicks on an ad and fills out a form, becoming a lead that is owned by the publisher. These leads can be sold to advertisers and investors in a liquid market This is a big idea. It will take a lot of pushing to get it off the ground, but if it works it will redefine online advertising and lead generation.",Attention_Trust,2005-11-25 00:00:00
,Deep Web Search – Two Approaches,https://techcrunch.com/2005/11/24/deep-web-search-dipsie-glenbrook/,"Silicon Beat had an interesting article about Palo Alto based Dipsie dCloak yesterday ( press release ), a product designed to help websites make their content more indexable by search engines. Much, if not most, of the web is considered “dark” because the data is not readily available via a permanent URI. Cookies, forms, javascript and flash can affect what content (or if any content) is shown on a page. Today, this information is not indexable by search engines. dCloak is a product that websites can use to make this content visable to the engines. There are, however, some concerns that the technology could be used by spammers to further promote their content. Glenbrook Networks is another company trying to tackle the Deep Web problem. However, they’re attacking this from the search engine side, which wouldn’t require website changes like dCloak. Glenbrook has developed a suite of proprietary unstructured information retrieval and extraction technology that trawls the Deep Web (see Jeff Clavier’s post here ) . The company has built a showcase around job search in the Bay Area (they were actually the first ones to deliver a job/google maps mashup), and is reportedly building an application in the local search space. The interesting thing about the Deep Web problem is that both sides, search engines and websites, want to make the content indexable. It will be interesting to see how this space evolves.",,2005-11-24 00:00:00
,Web 2.0 Companies I Couldn'T Live Without,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/30/web-20-companies-i-couldnt-live-without/,"There have been numerous 2005 “best of” and 2006 “predictions” posts over the last few weeks as the year comes to an end. I’m not going to write one of those. Giving out “best of” awards seems presumptuous to me, given that I’ve been blogging all of six months. And while predictions are fun, they aren’t all that useful in the end. What I do want to write about as I reminisce about the year ending in a couple of days are the Web 2.0 companies that I love and use every day. I’ve tested over a thousand products this year, and have written about hundreds. And while some of the companies I write about get very positive reviews, I find that the only true test of the value of a product is its staying power: do I continue to use the product, and maybe even pay for it, as the days and months go by? So for those of you that are curious, here is a short list of the companies that have held my attention, and that I would not choose to live without on the web: Bloglines I have a love/hate relationship with Bloglines, but they’ve recently improved performance dramatically, and I really like that I can see the number of subscribers for each feed. This was the hardest one to include on the list, but at the end of the day I couldn’t leave them off. Del.icio.us I use Del.icio.us multiple times every day to store and retrieve bookmarks. I freely admit that there are better solutions out there and I may very well switch to one of them in the near future, but you have to hand it to Del.icio.us for inventing the social bookmark phenomenon. FeedBurner I love the statistics Feedburner provides on feed readership and has lots of advanced features that are important to me. And despite what I’ve written in the past , I know and trust the FeedBurner team. I just wish they’d get rid of the advertisement on my feed page. :-) Flickr I enjoy Flickr more and more every day. I like seeing what my friends are up to based on the photos they upload as well as getting comments from others on my pictures. And I am starting to go back and upload old sets of photos from years ago. Flickr is just perfect. Measuremap The Measure Map blog analytics tool created by Adaptive Path gives me incredible insight into who is looking at what on TechCrunch. They need to deal with the speed issue for larger blogs though (it takes minutes sometimes to pull up stats, or just breaks). Memeorandum Memeorandum is how I keep up on the blogosphere when I don’t have time to read all of my feeds. It has also changed what I blog about, and how. Memeorandum is a cultural phenomenon. Netvibes Yeah, there are a lot of Ajax desktops out there, but Netvibes seems to stay ahead of the pack on functionality. The flickr stuff is great. Plus, how can I not love a service that includes TechCrunch as a default feed? :-) Omnidrive I’ve been waiting for something like this forever. I forsee a day when a service like Omnidrive comes packaged with a new PC, or is offered alongside web email solutions.  I’ve only had it for a few days, but I’m smitten. And fair disclosure: there are some awesome competitors out there, too, that I am just starting to look at. Pandora I listen to Pandora whenever I write – sometimes for hours a day. I’ve discovered countless new artists from it. Skype What can I say? Along with Vonage, Skype keeps my phone bills down to next to nothing, and it is an integral part of my everyday business and personal life. I would trade application sharing for the new video feature in a heartbeat, however. Technorati I use it more than Google. No one has launched anything better, yet. And they’ve made great progress in search speed over the latter half of the year. WordPress I love WordPress. Actually, let me rephrase that statement: I love WordPress 1.5. Version 2.0 makes me want to throw my laptop out of the window. But it is an amazing piece of software, and all of my blogs run on it. Yahoo Maps I use Yahoo Maps because it allows multi-point driving instructions, something none of the others offer yet. This was incredibly useful when I had to attend three or four holiday parties on the same evening.",Pandora; Technorati; Wordpress; Yahoo_Maps; FeedBurner,2005-12-30 00:00:00
,Ning – R.I.P.?,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/20/ning-rip/,"What happened to Ning ? It was the perfect service at the perfect time. Mashups are hot right now. Really hot. David Berlind oversold his MashUp Camp in a week and now has an impressive waiting list forming. And John Musser’s list of mashups continues to grow (see Richard MacManus’ post on this too). The idea of Ning, which launched in October 2005 , is brilliant. Let people easily create social applications tailored with difference web services. Allow others to clone those applications and take the code from them directly into whatever they are building instead of building from scratch. Watch everything evolve as better and better stuff gets built, which in turn is used to build even better stuff. Ning leverages the platform by aggregating the applications and selling advertising and premium tools/features. But the reality of Ning is that it’s lost whatever coolness it had, no one uses it and Ning is going to have a very hard time getting people’s attention when they finally do roll out better functionality. Here’s are the problems: First , You have to know PHP, or at least HTML, to build anything unique on Ning. They promise to create tools to allow non-programmers to build stuff in the future, but for now, 99.9% of the Internet population is effectively locked out from creating new stuff. Second , there is no support for the key web service APIs out there that people are really excited about mashing up. Instead, Ning has created a suite of custom applications …but which lack the scalability and functionality of what’s out there on the open web. Yes, you can pull in services like Google Maps if you have the programming skills to do so (see here for an example), but Ning does not pull these in as modules to get you started, which would be really compelling. Third , Ning keeps all of the applications under the ning.com roof. This has benefits like free hosting, but application creators don’t get control of the page to add advertising and they cannot get user registration data direclty. Users create a Ning account to use the mashups. That’s great for really small time stuff, but no one serious will build on the platform. Fourth , Ning did everything wrong in communicating with their users. At first they called it 24hourLaundry and no one knew what Ning would be. With the benefit of hindsight, this looks silly. No one was rushing to launch anything similar, and in fact telling users about their plans and getting feedback would have helped them build a better product. Even today, the Ning blog focuses on highlighting mashups, none of which are that great, instead of telling users when new and better features and tools will be released. They are not learning from their mistakes, and that is the worst thing of all. If the best thing you have to show the world is Kitten Wars , you are in trouble. This is not compelling stuff.",ning,2006-01-20 00:00:00
,Community Search With Yedda,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/25/community-search-with-yedda/,"There are only a few details emerging about Israel-based Yedda , which will be launching in the next month or so (the current home page is taking email registrations). My understanding is that the service will be somewhat similar to Yahoo Answers , Wondir, Google Answers and Oyogi , with some key differences that the founders hope will result in significantly more user participation, and better answers.",Yedda; Wondir,2006-01-25 00:00:00
,New Live.Com Services Shown At Searchchamps,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/25/new-livecom-services-shown-at-searchchamps/,"I am visiting Microsoft HQ in Redmond this week for their SearchChamps event. Attendance requires the signing of an nondisclosure agreement, and most of what is discussed is non-bloggable. However, the trade off is that we see stuff that is still being developed in the labs (some of it isn’t even at the demo-stage yet). A few of the services, however, are close to launch and are not covered by NDA. They include a new suite of Live.com services. This one excites me the most. Live.com is a fully extensible ajax homepage (see my review here ) – there are a ton of third party “gadgets” that can be added to the site and are available at microsoftgadgets.com . Google has a similarly extensible home page. However, unlike Microsoft, Google does not control the operating system for the large majority of worldwide personal computers. Sanaz Ahari, the program manager for Live.com, announced that Microsoft will allow gadgets to be dragged and dropped back and forth between live.com and the desktop (operating system). And they aren’t waiting for Vista – an update to Windows XP will be coming soon that will allow this drag and drop functionality. The result will be a Yahoo-Widgets like experience, and users will have the further ability to syncronize gadgets between the operating system and the live.com site. Sanaz Ahari also showed some new Live.com/Media Center integration. Anyone using Windows Media Center to record television (I do) will also be able to remotely control their media center to add/remove/edit recordings from any computer, via their passport account and a live.com gadget. We saw a demo of this today and its going to be pretty cool. Note that this is not an annoucement for “remote viewing”, although there are heavy rumors that this is the next step, and it seems pretty obvious. That, of course, will be bad news for Slingbox . Kris Barton at Microsoft also provided the following screenshot: Samir Lakhani gave a brief presentation and demo of the new classifieds product called Expo (formerly Fremont) ( my posts are here ). No real new information was released, although the product is clearly ready to launch. Live.com RSS feeds will soon also include images as well.

,Del.Icio.Us Competitors Try Paying Users,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/28/delicious-competitors-paying-users/,"At least two Del.icio.us competitors, Simpy and RawSugar ( profiles ) have begun paying users to use and promote their services. While the companies have different payment models, both pay based on traffic generated at a particular users page containing the user’s bookmarks. Otis Gospodnetic’s Simpy is allowing users to enter their Google Adsense account number and ads will be shown on their bookmark page. See Otis’ Simpy page for an example. Simpy is paying 100% of the proceeds from Google to the user for any ads on the page (in fact Google pays the user directly). Raw Sugar is taking a more direct approach – they are paying the top twenty “directories” (user bookmark pages) between $25 and $500 per month . Directories are ranked on raw traffic, and the first payouts were made earlier this month. RawSugar also plans to pay users a percentage of advertising revenue in a similar way as Simpy. Is this a gimick to generate attention or is it a viable long term strategy to generate user adoption? Pete Cashmore thinks these promotions should make Yahoo (now owner of del.icio.us) take notice (see his further thoughts in the comments below). Maybe he’s right. And the markets for these products are still in the very early adopter stage. But it is going to be hard for anyone to overcome the del.icio.us network effect (not to mention Yahoo’s marketing muscle) with relatively small direct economic incentives. I am, however, looking forward to seeing how these promotions drive new user registrations and site traffic. At the end of the day, these companies have nothing to lose with experiments like these.",Simpy,2006-01-28 00:00:00
,Nine Startups At E27 Summit,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/28/nine-startups-at-e27-summit/,"I attended the E27 Technology Conference today at Stanford University. Startups founded by entrepreneurs who are less than 27 years old were eligible to present. With a couple of exceptions these companies were all new to me, and a few have the potential to be real winners. The E27 founders did a great job of picking quality attendees (lots of venture capitalists, big company representatives and bloggers in the audience), and promising companies. The invite-only event was created by Noah Kagan , Shivani Sopory , and Nancy Gong. Below are my notes on each of the nine startups that presented. See Robert Scoble and Emily Chang for additional commentary, and Max Kiesler has a podcast recording of the entire event here . I wrote about BillMonk last week . The company, founded by Gaurav Oberoi and Chuck Groom, have created an excellent tool for managing social debts and IOUs. It’s easy to see this catching on. IOweYou is a competitor. 411Metro, is an advertiser-supported free 411 service. Derek Merrill presented the company. His co-founders are Alec Andronikov and Alexey Bulavin. 411Metro joins Free411 and 411 Save in this space, with a nearly identical business model of playing a short advertisment from a competitor to the requested business. The company is seed funded from Hummer Winblad and launched in November 2005 Standpoint, which launched today, is a “wikipedia of opinions”. At its core it is a simple blog for users to post their opinions and links to websites that help them form or support those opinions. Topics are grouped and the aggregate opinion of the community on any topic can be gauged. Co-founder Justin Smith presented. Gentry Underwood is Standpoint’s other founder. Robert Pazornik’s LicketyShip has the potential to be a big winner. It is an ecommerce service that can deliver purchased goods within two hours of placing the order. The magic? They combing local retail shops with the apparent over-capacity in the local courier market. Couriers pick items up at retail shops and deliver them immediately. Lickety Ship hopes to tap into the must-have-now crowd (Robert claims theat 30% of Amazon orders pay for overnight shipping, often paying more for shipping than for the item itself). The company is beta testing now in a few select cities. This reminds me of the good old days when we had kozmo to deliver a packet of skittles. The difference here is that customers will pay for this added convenience. Flagr was founded by Matt Colyer, David Wurtz adn Cole Poelker – all college dropouts from Boston. They are collecting emails on their site for a private beta…but the company promises to allow people to send tips on real world stuff in via a text message on a cell phone. Type in the title, address and comments, send it to Flagr and broadcast it to your friends or everyone. Their tagline is “sharewhere”. PlaceSite is another of my favorites from the event. They add their software to a standard wifi router and distribute them to cafe’s, events, etc. The result is a portal that all users of the network see that shows them current users of the network, allows instant messaging, etc. Their idea is to build more online community in these real world settings. Placesite is up and running at one location now – Cafe Couleur in San Francisco (16th and De Haro). The revenue model is super-local advertising, customized versions for venues (this is great for conferences), and permission based licensing of user data. I like it, and I want it on my home wifi. Given the focus on instant messaging, PlaceSite seems to be trying to address the same market at Meetro – giving people who are local to eachother a way to meet online. Box.Net is an online storage provider that launched in early 2005. They boast 4,300 paying users and funding by Mark Cuban. The founders, aaron Levie and Dylan Smith, were demonstrating the new functionality that they’ll be releasing in a couple of weeks. I’ll be writing more about Box.net and other companies in this space next week. This is a quickly evolving space. Noam Lovinsky is the founder of Skobee, a new service to help people plan events. They seem to be a direct competitor to Renkoo . The site is currently collecting emails for the beta. Both Skobee and Renkoo are focused on event planning (as opposed to an evite which looks at organizing people once the event specifics have been finalized). One thing I really like about Skobee is that users just email back and forth, cc’ing a unique skobee email address. Based on the live demo the service seems to be quite good at turning natural language into structured text. For instance, saying “Let’s do this on Monday instead” is understood by Skobee as a request for a date change and noted. Johnny Liu’s NeuroSky claims to have created “the world’s first consumer-minded nural device”. A longer description from their website is “Neurosky has developed a non-invasive neural sensor and signal processing technology that converts brainwaves and eye movements into useful electronic signals to communicate with a wide range of electronic devices, consoles, and computers”. Applications include controlling video games. Sort of scary and really cool.",Neurosky; box.net,2006-01-28 00:00:00

Is it also going to integrate directly with the desktop operating system ? Of course not. I am the champion of the small startup but I just can’t condone this kind of irresponsible behavior anymore. :-) Yes, I will continue to write about new ajax homepages, but I guarantee I will become more vitriolic with each one.

,"Tello – Good Product, Dumb Strategy?",https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/24/tellos-made-some-mistakes-already/,"Tello has been all over the news since last night. It hasn’t launched yet, but the promise is to allow people within your company and at trusted other companies to see your “presence”. This means you can tell if they are using a landline, cell phone or IM application. You can use the Tello application to communicate with them and share applications. The system will work with traditional phones, blackberries and IM clients, and looks to be a killer productivity tool. Tello raised $5.5 million from Eagle River, Evercore Partners, Rho Ventures and Intel Capital. The founders include John Sculley, Jeff PUlver, Craig McCaw and Michael Price. I’m looking forward to testing this out, and maybe using it for my business. But Tello has made some odd choices in the weeks before launch. First they clearly orchestrated a news blitz even though they are pre-launch. Ok, they got some great coverage. But why did they organize this way before launch? There won’t be as much hype on the day this goes live, when people can actually use the service. Second, they’ve obviously decided that the bloggers don’t matter much. Om Malik and Alec Saunders took the time to write about them. Even though they each command a large and very relevant audience, Tello didn’t bother to list either of them on the news page. Lots of other bloggers wrote about Tello too (including our own MobileCrunch ), but were not mentioned. Companies that don’t embrace bloggers tend to become attacked by bloggers. Companies that embrace bloggers, and thank them, get lots and lots of love. Third, and this is minor – what’s up with the circa 1995 stock photography on the home page? And no blog ? Does Tello intend to communicate with us via press releases? Of course, I will forget all of this (stock photography and all) if Tello is as cool as it looks like it might be. Update: I have never been ripped into as aggresively as I have in the comments to this post. Update: Tello has added blog posts to their news page . Good for them.",Tello,2006-01-24 00:00:00
,Fireant Just Rocks,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/24/fireant-just-rocks/,"FireAnt released some impressive and beautiful software earlier today. The company first launched in January 2005 with a downloadable Mac client that allowed users to aggregate video blog content and watch and/or download it to a device.  A Windows client was relased in May 2005, which includes the ability to transcode video from the original source into the specific formats needed for different devices. Until now, the FireAnt site was basically where you went to download the client. Today FireAnt released new versions of the clients. But they also released a website service that is totally awesome. The FireAnt site is now a full videoblogging directory that allows users to tag and rate videoblogs, subscribe to feeds and queue them up for watching or downloading. You can also watch any videoblog directly on the website in its original file format (this last point is important). The website and clients fully syncronize, so any videoblogs added or removed from your que on the site will automatically sync up with the client (users may use the website at work, and have the client installed at home along with their PSP, video iPod or other device). The result is an extremely versatile, file-type-agnostic videoblogging ecosystem. A tool like this was needed to allow videoblogging to expand to more users. FireAnt works closely with other videoblogging services like Mefeedia (a directory and aggregator) and Blip.tv (a service which, among other things, provides a great platform for videobloggers to host their content) to ensure that they are all launching compatible platform and application services. This coopetition is good for the industry. Let’s see how long it can last. :-) FireAnt has relocated from New York to San Francisco. Joshua Kinberg and Jay Dedman are the founders (there are seven or so employees now). Jay also worked with Mefeedia founder Peter Van Dijk to form the first video blogging email list before either company was founded. They are now tracking nearly 5,000 legitimate video blogs…up from only a handful a year ago.",Mefeedia; Blip.tv,2006-01-24 00:00:00
,Rent Your Parking Space At Car Harbor,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/23/rent-your-parking-space-at-carharbor/,"Car Harbor , which is still being developed and is far from launch (the link is to the blog), is going to solve a very common and frustrating real world problem – finding a parking space in a crowded city. Here’s how it will work: If you have a parking spot that you know you don’t need (like a driveway, during the working hours when you know you will be away from home), you can enter it into the network along with a price. People looking for a spot in a neighborhood can use their mobile phones to find local spots, and pay straight for it from their account. Simple. Car Harbor will launch first in San Francisco, and then roll out fast to other cities before the idea can be “borrowed”. I am looking forward to using this the next time I am up in the city for a baseball game. Advisors include Craig Newmark, Jim Lazarus and Scott Rafer.",,2006-01-23 00:00:00
,Pandora V. Last.Fm,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/23/655/,"Fred Wilson has a good post today comparing the Last.fm and Pandora music services. He’s strongly in favor of Last.fm. I use and have written about both services . Each allows you to find new music that you are likely to enjoy. Last.fm does this through analysis of what you listen to and like (and what others listen to and like). Pandora encodes different aspects of music and determines what you might like based on those factors. Pandora is easier to use because it takes absolutely no setup and streams music on the site itself. Last.fm uses tagging and has social network aspects, but you have to download the player to listen to music. I find Last.fm to be better at playing music I’ve heard before and like, whereas Pandora tends to introduce me to entirely new bands. Both are excellent. Tonight, in honor of Fred, I’ll be listening to Last.fm.",Pandora; Last.fm,2006-01-23 00:00:00

,The Techcrunch Products Index,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/22/the-techcrunch-products-index/,"I’ve launched an index of companies and products that have been written about here on TechCrunch. This is a much quicker way of finding information on things I’ve written about than using the search function. In fact, I was having trouble finding my own posts using standard search. If you know the name of the company, go to this page and simply click on it to see a list of all of the posts that mention it. This is self generating. Rachel Cunliffe took the basic code for the Ultimate Tag Warrior wordpress plugin (which was writen by Christine Davis) and modified it in a few key ways to suit my needs. The result is a page that lists each company I’ve written about. The interface for the publisher is basically the same as UTW. The changes Rachel made are mostly to the output page. We will post this to the WordPress Plugin Database later today or tomorrow so that anyone writing for WordPress can use it. Planned enhancements include creation of the index in OPML format as well. This index is also permanently linked from the top of the left sidebar on any TechCrunch page.",,2006-01-22 00:00:00

Adam Green argues both sides (see comments below for his further thoughts). MY opinion: Top 10 Sources properly attributes and links to the original blog content, and they allow blogs to opt out. No problem. And it is an excellent site for finding news. Combine this with Memeorandum’s or Tailrank’s ability to group conversations and we’ve got a real winner.",,2006-01-22 00:00:00

,Billmonk – Social Money,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/20/billmonk-social-money/,"BillMonk is a new service that allows people to easily keep track of financial debts among friends. It’s a simple idea and they’ve executed well. The idea is a user who wants to report a debt owed to him or her (such as a shared bill), or an IOU to another person, simply enters it on BillMonk. This is very easy to do on BillMonk, even for more complicated transactions like a bill shared among a lot of people. You simply input the amount of the bill and the email addresses for those who participated. There is also an SMS feature to allow users to text in bills on the phone. I like the way BillMonk keeps track of all of the various transactions a user has with different people, and the current amount owed at any given time. For instance, if I buy dinner for my friend Orli Yakuel and we decide to split the $100 bill, and later I owe her $8 for coffee, BillMonk knows that she only owes me a total of $42. When I tell BillMonk that she’s paid me $20, it automatically lowers the amount owed to me to $22. Of course, if the people I am emailing are not yet using the service, they can sign up. So they’ve got the viral angle covered. It’s useful, and really easy to use without FAQ references. There is also a way to SMS bills in via a mobile device. As of now, however, they have not integrated paypal or any other payment API. Scott Loftesness and John Cook have also recently written about BillMonk. The company was founded by Gaurav Oberoi and Chuck Groom, who previously worked at Amazon.",BillMonk,2006-01-20 00:00:00

The engine behind Bluepulse is platform and tool set they have created called the OADP which claims to “allows developers to develop mobile applications without having to worry about supporting the hundreds of different devices available on the market, connectivity issues, distribution and billing.” The test applications they’ve built on the platform are pretty compelling.

,Feedxs – Rss For Everyone,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/18/feedxs-publish-directly-to-rss/,"Netherlands-based FeedXS , which launched today, forces you to think about RSS in it’s purest form: a way to broadcast content. Jeroen Bertrams, one of the founders (the other founder is Hans Veldhyzen van Zanten) said in an email: “we are trying to make rss feeds accessible for the masses”. The idea is to allow anyone to publish an RSS feed. Skip the blog. Go right to a feed, perhaps as a replacement to email to distribute personal news about yourself. The company feed is here , for instance. It’s more of an administrative interface and the content is designed to be read via the actual feed only. The publishing interface has a few formatting helpers but is in need of an overhaul. But there is something really unique here – you can publish directly from MSN messenger . Once you are registered on the site you simply add “msn@feedxs.com” as a contact. You have to authenticate yourself (log in) the first time, and after that publishing is very easy. So who’s the target market? Well, not bloggers, probably. And given that there is a need to understand what RSS is and how it is used, it’s not for mainstream uses either. But it is an extremely easy way to broadcast content to people via the MSN messenger feature. And I love that it exploits RSS in a somewhat new and interesting way.",,2006-01-18 00:00:00

,"Tagworld Does Video, Too",https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/17/tagworld-does-video-too/,"Santa Monica-based TagWorld , a MySpace competitor, launched an admirable music product last month. Tomorrow they launch video and an upgraded upload client (the uploader is PC only for now). As an aside, TagWorld claims half a million member registrations (launch was in November 2005). This is far short of MySpace’s 50ish million, of course, but it is impressive growth. Tagworld is taking a decentralized approach to video. Users may upload video in just about any format directly to their TagWorld storage (all users are given a gb of storage to use for video, music and any other type of file). Alternatively, videos from YouTube and other video sharing sites can be “bookmarked” directly into the My Videos area, and/or directly into the user’s TagWorld page for streaming to visitors. I have not seen a solution that offers both uploading and bookmarking functionality, allowing users to choose to upload or just point to another site for video. This seems like an evolutionary step forward to me. Since TagWorld is also operating a virtual storage service as well by giving users a gb of free storage, they’ve developed a client based uploader tool to handle large files and folders. TagWorld automatically detects if a file is music/audio, video, or another type of file and categorizes it approriately. If a user uploads a folder containing a video, and song and a word document, those files are places in My Music, My Video and My Files, accordingly. Again, I’ve not seen this on any other service. A mac client is in development. The Uploader is live now, Video goes live tomorrow morning around 9 am.",Tagworld,2006-01-17 00:00:00

,Tailrank Is Looking Good,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/17/tailrank-is-looking-good/,"Kevin Burton’s TailRank is making real gains against blog-news innovator Memeorandum , which I wrote about here and here . Memeorandum and TailRank are both trying to aggregate blog and other edge content in near-real time and group content by topics/events. The result is a “newspaper for the blogosphere” that delivers breaking news to readers far ahead of traditional news services, or even Google news (the downside is that conversation swarms can occur around ultimately baseless stories). Compare TailRank’s original interface from a post back in September to what they have now . In addition to a more usable interface, Tailrank has also started to group blog “conversations”, where different bloggers talk about similar topics, in a way I have not seen anywhere except Memeorandum to date. Memeorandum is still better at breaking news – A headline on Memeorandum may not appear on TailRank until a day or more later – but TailRank is still much younger than Memeorandum and could catch up. And new companies like Australia-based Tinfinger (still pre-launch and sans content) and Blogniscient ( profile ) are gunning for this space as well. The core back end difference between the services is that Gabe Rivera, the founder of Memeorandum, hand picked the original “seed” blogs with subsequent sources discovered by his system (guaranteeing quality but sacrificing breadth), whereas most of TailRank’s content comes directly from users who upload their favorite blogs in OPML format (the file format that most RSS readers like Bloglines and Rojo use to store feeds). The additional breadth of coverage offered by TailRank may be the cause of its lag behind Memeorandum in breaking news.",Tailrank,2006-01-17 00:00:00
,The Gather.Com Issue,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/16/the-gathercom-issue/,"“News 2.0” sites are launching faster than I can keep up. Gather is the most recent. Gather is a social news site that allows user to submit content and generate a revenue share based on activity on the site. They boast $7m in venture funding over two rounds. So that’s the good news. I usually don’t post about companies I don’t like unless I can be constructive. I am going to point out some weaknesses in Gather.com. These are only my opinion, but I think there are some serious flaws here. First, the site is poorly designed, very cluttered and doesn’t clearly state what they are doing. Second, Newsvine (early post on them), which is still in private beta, has shown the power of combining news items with user comments. It’s an obvious way to combine edge content with user interaction and prove the value of being a middleman. Gather doesn’t do this. Third, the revenue sharing won’t work. Steve Rubel says why – the market is saturated (although unlike Steve I applaud them for at least trying to get advertisers directly and fighting Google’s ridiculously undisclosed revenue share percentage). My main issue is that I don’t think this will provide enough of an incentive to get users attention. Fourth, Gather encourages tagging of news items and yet has a rigid directory taxonomy (meaning at the end of the day that they do not trust tags to create their directory). Bad idea. Go with the tags, drop the taxonomy and see what develops. Bloggers are generally giving Gather a big thumbs down. Mathew Ingram does a particularly good job in talking about all the competitors. He left out the massively funded Inform.com though, another service that has struggled with product direction but that is clearly taking criticisms constructively .",Gather,2006-01-16 00:00:00

,Nuvvo Takes On Open Source Moodle,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/16/nuvvo-takes-on-open-source-moodle/,"The online Learning Management System space is set to grow massively over the coming years as more and more education takes place on the web. Nuvvo launched a few days ago with an interesting service in this market. Nuvvo, which is free, allows educators to create courses with an great Ajax interface (watching the tour makes me realize how useful Ajax can be with applications like this). There are also modules to assist with charging students for the course (if the educator chooses to charge), create tests, grade, etc. The hard work goes into creating the content, not figuring out how to use Nuvvo. Current courses are listed here . Nuvvo makes money from ads and by taking 8% of any course fees set by the educator. Since 2000, Moodle has been a popular open source choice in this space. However, Moodle requires a server installation whereas Nuvvo is a web application. Moodle also generally requires more techical expertise, while Nuvvo does a lot more hand-holding.

,"Podzinger Launches, Moves Podcast Search Forward",https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/14/podzinger-launches-moves-podcast-search-forward/,"Podzinger , which I wrote about briefly last month along with two other services, officially launched a couple of days ago. Podzinger is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts In my post last month, admittedly when Podzinger was still deep in development, I could not make it work. I am still having problems with core funtionality. Podzinger uses speech recognition technology that is supposedly also used by the CIA and other government organizations to turn podcast audio into searchable text. In a few quick searches , it seemed to be returning relevant results. Results can be listed by date or relevancy. Users can listen to podcasts direclty from the search results, or download the file. Users can also subscribe to the feed or the search results via RSS. This is where I ran into problems. A “killer” feature of Podzinger is the ability to listen just to the snippet that contains the search term. Links appear within the result that can be clicked on to hear the snippet. I see the links and click on them, but cannot get a single one to play. This issue is addressed in the FAQs, and it suggest either using Real Player or being patient. However, I am getting actual errors, not just long delays. Assuming they get this working properly, it’s a great way to search for content within podcasts and other audio files. A perfect new feature would be the ability for publishers and users to tag additional content within the file and allow others to jump right to that. Also, Podzinger is obviously fully transcribing the podcasts…although I cannot seem to find the full transcriptions anywhere. If the transcription exists and has a permanent URL, I imagine podcasters would link to it like crazy. Podzinger is supported by advertising and is also rolling out a cost-per-click product to allow podcasters to sell advertising into transcripts.",Podzinger,2006-01-14 00:00:00

,Dogster Turns Two,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/13/dogster-turns-two/,"Dogster , led by founder and CEO Ted Rheingold, turned two years old yesterday. The company is located in San Francisco. Dogster is a home page site just for dogs. You can see the page for my dog, Laguna, here as an example. A key part of the site is social interaction among dogs, and Laguna has a number of “friends” that are linked on the page. Dogster also allows tagging of photos, and has just launched a Groups feature (there are already 239 Groups) In general, humans do not interact and you do not know who the dogs’ owners are. For a lot of dog-crazy owners, this is perfect. Needless to say, Dogster has some pretty loyal users, and the site statistics reflect this: Dogster even has a search engine for dog friendly hotels. The story of Dogster is great, too. Ted was out of work and taking odd jobs here and there, and decided to just follow a dream and create the site. Within 3 months the site was cash flow positive and by month 18 Dogster was profitable. The company never raised outside funds other than from friends and family Dogster generates revenue from premium accounts ($20 per year), advertising, and sponsorships both on the side and for things like “ The World’s Coolest Dog and Cat Show “, which was sponsored by Target, Nintendo and others. The show, by the way, had 20,000 entrants and over 1,000,000 total votes. Catster (launched in June 2004) is Dogster’s sister site, but I hate cats and refuse to write about it. :-)",,2006-01-13 00:00:00
,When Will Yahoo Acquire Technorati?,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/12/when-will-yahoo-acquire-technorati/,"Yahoo’s recent acquisition binge is the topic of a Red Herring print article this week called “Hungry Hungry Yahoo”. Liz Gannes, who wrote the article, discusses Yahoo’s recent acquisitions and speculates on a few likely candidates for future Yahoo shopping sprees. The article lists 37 Signals, MeasureMap, Digg, YouTube and Technorati as the ones to watch. (Note: Liz interviewed me for this article last month and I am quoted in it) Liz goes on to write that Technorati is the most likely to be bought: CEO Dave Sifry’s response? Well, “no comment” be damned, I believe that Yahoo should, and even may, acquire Technorati in the near future. First of all , Yahoo has already acquired the “fraternal twins” of tagging – Flickr and Del.icio.us . Both were pioneers in their respective markets, and relatively cheap ($20 – $30 million each). Flickr made tagging of pictures popular; Del.icio.us did the same with bookmarks. But Flickr and Del.icio.us are not twins. They are tagging triplets along with Technorati, which created and popularized blog tagging in 2005. Today, the majority of blogs use tags and categories to label their posts. Second , Technorati should be just about out of money. They raised a speculated $14 million in the summer of 2004 from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Mobius Venture Capital and August Capital. If they’ve raised more since then it has not been announced (or leaked). I know of a few unannounced financings, but I have not heard anything about Technorati raising additional venture capital. Technorati may need money. Third , Yahoo’s blog search isn’t great . Technorati’s blog search is the best on the web right now after much needed upgrades over the last six months. So, in my opinion, an acquisition makes sense. Stephen Baker at Business Week thinks Microsoft will be the suitor. But it’s got to be Yahoo. Why won’t it happen? Given today’s funding environment Technorati may be (or have already) raised additional funds to take them to the next level. And given an approximate $30 million valuation even back in 2004, it would take a much larger acquisition than the $30-$50 million we are seeing in deals today to get them. Technorati’s VCs just wouldn’t pull the trigger, and they certainly have veto rights over an acquisition. In the end, I just want this to happen. The tagging triplets need to be under one roof.",Technorati,2006-01-12 00:00:00

,Three New Classifieds Companies,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/12/three-new-classifieds-companies/,"I’ve been watching three new web 2.0 classifieds sites – BlockRocker , rbloc and theadcloud . And for those of you who say I focus on silicon valley companies, I have a surprise for you – all three of these companies are located outside of the U.S. BlockRocker is in Winnipeg, rbloc is in Calgary and theadcloud is in Chile. None of these are in any position to kill of Craigslist any time soon, but all three have interesting features and contribute to the overall discussion of what a classified ad site should be all about. I wish I could add Microsoft’s Fremont project to this post as well, but I do not yet have a green light to write about them. Here are the details on each: BlockRocker , which is a one man show created by Rod Edwards in Winnipeg, is focused on geography. The site has integrated Google maps in a way that reminds me of Trulia (for real estate search). BlockRocker launched on December 1, 2005 and is still working out some bugs. The site allows publisher tagging of classifieds and has RSS feeds for all searches. Listings are free. rbloc , which is also based in Canada, hasn’t really launched yet (there are no listings). But the functionality is there and I like aspects of it. rbloc is completely focused on local (the name is a play on “our block”, as in our street). It supports both set price and auctions for ads, as well as “wanted”. The idea is to create more of a marketplace around similar stuff. Also, they have a paid ads area to the left of listings. Actual ad listings are free. Some actual content would be nice, of course. But I’m always patient with new services, unlike all of you people. :-) Chile-based theadcloud is the youngest of these very young services, but already seems to have the most legs. Everything is tags, tags, tags – no taxonomies here. Listings are free, and you can submit to as many cities as you like (all cities have feeds, as do tag searches within cities). And they have another feature which I really like – user comments on individual ads. This thing is only days old, but I really like it.",,2006-01-12 00:00:00

,Aol Acquires Truveo,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/aol-acquires-truveo/,"AOL announced the acquisition of media search engine Truveo today. My original profile of Truveo is here . Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly, but this was not a small deal. Truveo has an innovative way for quickly indexing media content such as audio and video, and figuring out what it is even if there is little or no meta data associated with it. It is an incredibly useful technology and search engine. I like Truveo, which launched in September, because it relies on a core hard-to-duplicate technology rather than a  business plan which creates a network effect. The only other web 2.0 company that I can think of off the top of my head that is similar is Riya, which is also building some very tricky stuff. This doesn’t mean I don’t like network-effect companies. To the contrary, I love them. But if you can build something that is protectable on the IP side as well, then you may just have a large liquidity event, too. Jeff Clavier is an advisory to Truveo and wrote about the acquitision today as well. I’ve gotten to know Jeff quite a bit over the last few months. I am not saying he is fully or even mostly responsible for this acquisition (I have no idea), but I do think that he adds a lot of value to his clients and his “stamp of approval” is becoming a seriously valuable asset. If you are luck enough to work with him, your chances of success increase dramatically.",Truveo; AOL,2006-01-10 00:00:00
,More Edge Reviews – Inods,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/more-edge-reviews-inods/,"The rise of edge content continues – iNods , which launched today, is the most recent example. iNods aggregates blog and other edge review content and displays it in a centralized way for users. Unlike similar services kritX and blogcritics , which aggregate general review information contained on blogs (and are excellent), iNods is completely focused on shopping. Like the others, iNods has realized that there is a massive amount of review information out there in the blogosphere. And more is being created every day. They are harvesting that information, making it searchable, and driving highly targeted traffic right back to the blogs to read that content. They also require blog registration to include content, although they do already have fairly deep content and so I assume they have added some sources without their registration. They say that they will support microformats in the future, but at this point it is not a requirement. This means bloggers do not need to format their data in any particular way to have it included on iNods. I’d like to see these services expand their technology so as not to require blogger registration or microformats (kritX, blogcritics and iNods all require one or both of these). This is a harder problem to solve because they need to go through every blog post and figure out what is relevant to their service. Structured blogging initiatives and/or blogger registration certainly make it easier for services like this to recognize and gather the specific edge content they are looking for, I do not believe it is necessary. Existing tagging and syndication platforms are all the tools these vertical search engines need. There is no way centralized review sites like Yelp, Riffs, Judy’s Book and others can compete with the blogosphere over the long run. Those sites will also have to gather decentralized content, or become meaningless. More and more people are realizing this and writing about it – a good post by Rachel Cunliffe (one example) is here.",kritx,2006-01-10 00:00:00

,"1000Tags – Another Stupid, Brilliant Idea",https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/10/1000tags-another-simple-brilliant-idea/,"I was talking with an entrepreneur earlier today about about milliondollarhomepage and what a simple, brilliant concept it is. It’s one of those things that will really only work once (although I have some further thoughts on that below). 1000Tags is different enough from MillionDollarHomePage that I think it will have a lot of sucess, too. They call it “the first commercial tag cloud”. And that’s exactly what it it. You can purchase a tag, pay by the character and font size, and hope that a lot of traffic to your site is the result. They are selling up to 1,000 tags. Tags can be exclusive (click the Star Wars tag), but cost significantly more, and they will only sell 50 of them. The remaining tags link to a results page with what appears to be an unlimited number of results (click the Download Music tag). Like MDH, this site is a proof of concept that cannot be easily copied. Duplicate sites will clearly not have the ability to get the same level of attention. However, I do think already established websites could add a commercial tag cloud, or MDH-like banner area for logos, and generate (one time?) revenue from it. Perhaps 1000tags and MDH could even supply the APIs and service to do this. Is this an incredibly cool new web 2.0 business? No. But it is a smart idea that I wish I had thought of and executed on. Good for them. Thanks, Luis Salfro, for emailing me about this.",,2006-01-10 00:00:00
,Don'T Blow Your Beta,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/09/dont-blow-your-beta/,"I’ve seen hundreds of new products launch over the last six months, and I think I have some pretty good advice for companies that want to improve their beta release. In addition to my personal experiences with companies, I recently wrote “ What Annoys You Most About Betas? ” on Crunchnotes to help me prepare for this post. The comments to that post give a lot of direct feedback from early adopters and much of that information is reflected here as well. Every company does things a little differently. Some rush the product out, features-be-damned. Others wait, and wait, and wait, until its “perfect”. Some companies are secretive. Others open. And so on. Certainly there is no set recipe for success (or failure). But there are a number of easy-to-avoid traps when building and presenting a product. Likewise, there are a number of “crowd pleaser” features that always get positive comments. First Impressions The main thing to remember is that you generally only get one look from the early adopter crowd. There is just too much going on for them to give a flawed company multiple chances to get it right. You either grab their attention, or you lose their attention. If you grab ’em, everything is easier from then on. If you bore them, you are facing an incredible uphill battle just to get them back to the site. So, basically, don’t blow your first impression. Once they’ve made the decision that you are not noteworthy, it is very hard to get them to pay attention again. Rolling Feature Release Somewhere along the line people got the idea that rolling out functionality in stages is a good thing. There are two arguments for this. First, it allows an earlier launch. Ok. That’s true. The second argument is that by releasing features in stages, you’ll have regular news that bloggers and other journalists can talk about. This is also true, but a lot of companies get a little too religious about this and start to pull features just so that they will have news down the road. I hear this all the time from companies – “please don’t write about this feature yet. we want to release it next month and get you to write about us again then.” If your first impression is positive, people will want to hear about future news. If it isn’t, people won’t care. Focus on making that launch a memorable one. Every new feature is not news. Incomplete Features Some people take the “rolling feature release” idea above to mean they can release half-baked stuff. This allows for a quicker launch, of course. Slap a label on it, like “developer release”, “alpha” or “beta” and the hope is that people will be understanding and kind, and give you good advice and suggestions for improvement and evolution. This is a bad idea. You will be crucified for wasting people’s time and they will leave brutal comments slamming your product. It is far better to delay launch, or remove the feature entirely, than show stuff that doesn’t work. This is a “fall on your sword” issue. If the team is pressing to do this, spend political capital in fighting it. Your equity will be worth more because of it. Pre-launch labels do not protect you from scorn. The Browser Issue Internet Explorer has dominant market share, and (at least today) you must work on IE to get mass consumer adoption. However, most of the early adopters use Firefox, and a lot of them use Macs. At one point, 80% of TechCrunch readers used the Firefox or Safari browsers . If you don’t support Firefox and, to a lesser extent, Safari, when you launch, you are going to be shunned by the early adopters. Landing Pages Many companies put up a basic landing page while they are in development. These landing pages usually ask for people’s email address, promising notification when the product launches. I personally like landing pages because it gives me something to point to when writing about a pre-release product. But many users don’t like them. A common complaint from people is that they sign up on a landing page and don’t hear anything for months (so they forget all about it). Another complaint is that the landing page doesn’t give clear information on what the product will do. If you are going to do it, make sure that launch is imminent and that you give fairly detailed information on the product vision. Bloggers and Blogging Most early adopters read blogs. A lot of them write blogs, too. Engage with bloggers. They are a powerful way to spread your vision, and they are generally much more technically adept than the average big publication journalist. They don’t have to deal with editors and fact checkers (for better or worse), and so it is often easier to get your pure vision out there for the world to read. You should also publish a blog. Not only is it the best way to tell the world about what you are doing, it also gives you the opportunity to repay bloggers who write about you with a link back to them. Don’t underestimate the importance to a blogger of being linked to on your blog. Just like you, bloggers want mind share. Never, never, never attack your critics on your blog or in comments on other blogs. Engage with them and be constructive even if they are not. Even if they are dead wrong, thousands of other people probably have had the same thought and haven’t bothered to write about it. Don’t assume they are a jerk; rather, assume that your communications are flawed and need to be re-thought. You are going to have to develop a very thick skin. Obvious Trust Issues Don’t ask for more personal information from your users than you absolutely need. Yes, having good demographic information on your users, like zip code and birth date, is a valuable asset. But many people won’t sign up for services that are asking for more information than absolutely necessary, or will purposefully enter false information. Don’t break people’s trust during the registration process. Be like Netvibes if you can and offer a near-complete service without registration at all. Summary My guess is that there will be even more useful suggestions given directly by users in the comments to this post. These comments are even more important than what I write, so you should listen carefully to this feedback. There are a number of recent posts by others that will be at least indirectly useful to companies launching betas as well. I highly recommend reading these: Stephen Bryant: 2006: First Thing We Do, Let’s Kill All the Betas Adam Green: The danger of beta burnout Fred Oliveira: Fewer templates, more user experience (good advice on design and usability) Rob Hof: Best Way to Post Video Clips to Share Publicly?

,Toshiba To Push Blog Reviews To Mobile Shoppers,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/08/toshiba-to-get-blog-reviews-to-mobile-shoppers/,"There is a report that Toshiba is developing software that will allow people to take a picture of the bar code label of many products, send it to a related service and quickly receive back information related to the product. The data the service returns? From blogs. Yep, Toshiba will send back summary information on how many blogs gave the product positive and negative reviews. Related product information will also be displayed. There is no information now about how Toshiba will go about gathering and analyzing blog data, and whether the data will need to be in a structured format or not. It is also unclear as to whether this will initially launch only in Japan or worldwide. I think one of the bigger challenges of the service is pairing the blog data with the bar code. As the service launches, sometime in 2006, I’ll be all over this if I can get access to it. Products covered are primiarily consumer electronics products, food, books, CDs, DVDs and cosmetics. The fact that Toshiba is looking to edge, consumer driven content instead of a proprietary database to gather product information is stunning. Two thumbs up.

,"Allpeers Is The Firefox ""Killer App""",https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/03/allpeers-is-the-firefox-killer-app/,"I’ve had a chance to talk to AllPeers founders Cedric Maloux and Matthew Gertner. This company is set to take the world by storm. In my opinon this single firefox extension will massively increase the attractiveness of that already popular browser, drawing more millions away from embattled Internet Explorer. AllPeers is a simple, persistent buddy list in the browser. Initially, interaction with those buddies will be limited to discovering and sharing files – If you choose to, you can share any file on your network with one or more of your friends. They will be able to see what files you choose to share (even getting an RSS feed of new files you include), and with a single click download it to their own hard drive. AllPeers will work even when the sharer is offline – AllPeers is a bittorent client, and will allow files to be pulled from multiple sources. When downloading, the file may be grabbed partially or fully from others you have shared it with (or who shared it with you). So a user just clicks on a file, and waits for it to eventually download. Screen shots can be viewed here . With AllPeers, I can share photos and home movies with my parents, songs (and anything else) with friends, and also access the files that they choose to share. In the future, AllPeers will also have folders to allow public sharing (probably with restrictions to control copyright violations). I also assume they will build chat and VOIP functionality into the application as well. AllPeers will not be advertising funded. There are hints that the business model may eventually be centered on monetization of paid content, but that will be down the road. For now, they are focused on launching with the basic shared-folder approach. And that is fine with me – I’ll be hooked from the second I can get my hands on it. AllPeers has seven employees, is based in Prague and is a UK company. They are self and angel funded to date. If you’d like to sign up for the beta, enter your email here . An initial batch of beta testers should get their hands on it later this month. Thanks Greg and Jordan for telling me about this.",,2006-01-03 00:00:00

But founder Kevin Carey has a big trick up his sleave – not only does he allow user submitted links to have affiliate codes, he absolutely encourages it.

,Echosign Solves Signature Page Woes,https://techcrunch.com/2006/01/02/echosign-solves-signature-page-woes/,"I just spent some time looking at EchoSign , a new service launched by Jason Lemkin and Jeff Zwelling. EchoSign helps you keep executed documents organized. Document writing and negotiation has been largely handled online, via emails, for the last ten years (before that, fedex and faxing of versions back and forth was the way to go). However, when it comes time to execute a final agreement, both sides generally print the document and fax it back to the other side. Unless someone scans the signature pages and creates a pdf, there is no electronic signed copy. Efax helps somewhat and I often ask people to send docs to my efax number so that I have an electronic copy. But Echosign, besides being free, goes further. Once a document is finalized, you simply upload it to the site and use their interface to email it out to everyone. The emailed document includes a fax cover sheet with the fax number pre-filled. The other side simply prints it, signs it, and sends it to the fax number on the pre-printed form. The original party then receives a pdf version of the signed document for filing, printing and/or forwarding. I have no idea what the business model is, since its a free service, but EchoSign definitely fixes a big problem for lawyers and companies trying to keep executed agreements and other documents organized. I’ve looked at other services that are trying to solve the version control of documents…hosting a word or other document that the parties can change and finalize is a great idea and something law firms would easily pay for. Writely and the other ajax office application companies would tweak their services to accomplish this of course. In the meantime, I would really like to see EchoSign create an API and allow services like writely to built the signature piece right in.",,2006-01-02 00:00:00

For instance, there is a pre-created module to show recent del.icio.us bookmarks for a given user, recent flickr pictures for a given user, etc. I have not seen this type of functionality in the other services I’ve reviewed. HomePortals also has a very nice blogging tool module (see it in action on the HomePortals blog ). Now this is getting interesting: I can see using the blogging tool, and adding in my flickr pictures and del.icio.us bookmarks to give visitors a really in depth overview of who I am and what’s going on in my life.

It’s a web 2.0 company that has the ancillary benefit of helping others. The basic system is: register and post if you need a favor or have a favor to give. Things I see on the site now include a post for a free mattress , and a request for help writing a wikipedia article. After favors are completed, members are asked to make a rating of the other person. And if you help someone or are helped, the other person is automatically added to your network. Favorville is young and has very little traffic.

,Dave Winer'S Newest Adventure,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/29/dave-winers-newest-adventure/,"Dave Winer announced today that he’s built a new RSS aggregator, built on his OPML editor platform. He’s released it to the OPML community for early testing. Some details are here . The aggregator will have advanced podcasting/videocasting support and will also include a “ reading lists ” feature. The idea around reading lists is to allow people to subscribe to other people’s list of recommended feeds (in OPML format), and have those lists update as feeds are added or removed. Seems simple, but no one does it now. The aggregator will be in the “river of news” format, as opposed to folder based like Bloglines. The reason? Dave likes it that way.

,Wordpress 2.0 – The Good And The Bad,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/28/wordpress-20-the-good-and-the-bad-2/,"We’ve switched TechCrunch over to WordPress 2.0 . Not everyone is interested in the feature set of the WordPress blogging platform, so I’ll keep this brief. To see a good overview of the new features, see Asymptomatic . A big change is the ability to create categories on the fly, from the post page, with Ajax. This was previously a multi step process. Since Technorati and other blog search engines view categories as synonyms to tags, this is a quick way for most users to quickly and easily tag their posts without adding additional code. Another big improvement is the enhanced “view post preview” function. This shows the post exactly as it will look on the blog, with all formatting and CSS that will be applied. This is a welcome feature. They’ve also added a wysiwyg rich text editor. I disabled this immediately, although many users will like it. Now for the bad. The new image uploader is a train wreck. Yes, they’ve moved it to the post page which removes a click. However, what took a couple of steps before now takes five or six because I format images in a very particular way which the uploader doesn’t support. It also has default settings, like thumbnails, that require extra clicks to get This needs to be fixed or I will literally go crazy. At the very least, just showing me the URL string for the uploaded image will get me back some of the functionality lost. The image URL folder is now reset every month as well, and so I can’t easily find old images, either. They didn’t think through this very well, or at all. Transition took a few days (yes, days) before comments and images were showing properly (thank you, Bryan , for doing this) The support site provides some help, but the depth of questions and obvious user frustration shows that many, including me, should have tested it out before transitioning our entire blog there.",Automattic,2005-12-28 00:00:00
,Omnidrive – Online Storage Perfection,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/28/omnidrive-online-storage-perfection/,"I’ve been testing Omnidrive ‘s very early beta product over the last few days. Omnidrive will be launching in January, 2006. I’ve spent hours with it (and previously posted a brief mention ) – significantly more than I spend with most products. The reason? This is a product that I and millions of others really need – a pure and functional online storage product with key web 2.0 features. Omnidrive is based in Australia, but is as good or better than anything else I’ve seen out of silicon valley recently. It has been in development for 12 months. Access & Features Users have two ways to upload, view and interact with files. The first is a web interface that allows for fairly easy file uploading. Users have three main folder options to start – private, shared and public. By placing a file in the shared folder, other people you’ve allowed in can see and download the file. If placed in the public folder, everyone can access the file. Omnidrive is also releasing a toolbar to assist with the web interface. The second way to access files is via a download (they support PC and Mac now, pocket PC later) that creates a virtual Omnidrive drive. This is THE way to upload or download big batches of files at once. Drag in a multi-gigabyte folder and Omnidrive will work away at it in the background until its fully uploaded or downloaded. The other features, some of which are still being built, include: Pricing Pricing is a tough area for Omnidrive. They face storage and, more importantly, bandwidth costs that can be significant on a per user basis. In a post I wrote back in November (when I first heard of Omnidrive), I wrote that these services needed to give some storage for free, and “lots” for cheap. Founder Nik Cubrilovic responded in a post that my pricing needs were crazy, but agreed that there needs to be a compelling price point to get mass user adoption. Their current pricing reflects this thinking. They will give a gig or two of storage for free, and sell 10 gb bundles above that for “not more than” $70 per year. That’s pricy, but way below the industry standard right now. And of course there will have to be bandwidth throttles. Since files can be public, outgoing bandwidth can be a massive cost for them. Pricing I’m saying this flat-out. Omnidrive is in a position to dominate a market with tremendous pent up demand. I’ve looked at a number of competing services and no one is doing anything close to what they are in functionality and usability. This service, or a white label version of it, should be built in to every new computer and operating system, and many web applications. With an appropriate API in and out, and rock-bottom pricing, Omnidrive can own a very large market niche. The cost problem is not trivial, and for a self funded startup taking an up front cost with the promise of long-term customer loyalty is difficult to say the least. But the opportunity is there. This company needs to get funded and start acquiring users, immediately.",Omnidrive,2005-12-28 00:00:00
,Magnatune'S Answer To The Music Problem,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/28/magnatunes-answer-to-the-music-problem/,"Magnatune , founded by John Buckman in 2003, is a music label with an associated website. Today was the first time I heard about Magnatune (thanks to Ajay Juneja ), but I agree entirely with their business philosophy. I really think this is the music business model of the future. There are two key business model issues to note that make Magnatune different. The first is that Magnatude allows buyers to download music completely free of DRM and in the format (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC and AAC) and quality of their choice (very similar to grey market allofmp3.com , but in this case with the artist’s express permission). As I’ve written before , I think this is the only way a label or artist can charge for music – no DRM and offering a choice of formats and quality. Albums sell for $5 and up (the buyer decides if he or she wants to pay more). Sales include downloadable cd art and inserts. CDs may also be purchased for delivery. The second business model difference is how Magnatune treats its artists . They share a flat 50% of gross proceeds (before any costs) from music sales with artists. They also share 50% of merchandise sales profits, although they have not started selling merchandise yet. Magnatune doesn’t take on any artist that applies – only about 2.5% of those that apply are accepted according to an article by Stereophile . Magnatune also gives the buyer the legal right to share the music with three other people, even allowing those people to download the music directly from Magnatune (a great viral marketing feature, by the way). Of course, without DRM, the music can be shared anyway, but giving people the right to do this is a nice touch. And if you lose your music, you can re-download it from Magnatune at no additional cost ( Dave Winer will love this). Yes, there are no high profile artists currently signed. But if Magnatune can get even a single big artist to move to them, they’ll be on the map permanently, and the artist will make a lot more money.",,2005-12-28 00:00:00
,Diigo – Enough Evolution?,https://techcrunch.com/2005/12/27/diigo/,"Diigo , which stands for “Digest of Internet Information, Groups and Other stuff”, is a social bookmarking site that allows users to highlight multiple content areas, including pictures, tag the page, and bookmark it. Users can also add sticky notes to a highlighted text area. It has other good features as well – see the flash demo for a good overview. Many of the bookmarking sites are starting to blur together for me. I like Diigo and the founders are politely efficient in getting the word out. The company has also executed well and released a polished product. But at the end of the day I’m not sure how many social bookmarking sites can make the cut. I will say this, though. I like the idea of public and private “sticky” notes on a website ( Activeweave promises this, and I saw a really great demo two months ago, but it hasn’t launched yet). And I also like the ability to highlight multiple areas of a website in my bookmarks ( Kaboodle does a great job of this). But, as you can see, for just about every feature, there are multiple companies already attacking the space with vigor. Good luck to all. It’s going to be a long, hard fight.

,"Yahoo Photos Overview, Exclusive Screenshots",https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/08/yahoo-photos-overview-exclusive-screenshots/,"It isn’t entirely fair to compare the new Yahoo Photos with all of the early stage companies showing their stuff at Demo. But its a very impressive product and it’s good that they came here to demo it. The new Yahoo Photos will be launching this spring. Everyone knows that Yahoo owns Flickr , the wildly popular photo tagging and sharing service that they bought in late 2004. But what most people don’t know (I didn’t) is that around 30 million unique monthly visitors come to Yahoo Photos (the other Yahoo photo service) v. about 8 million on Flickr. Flickr has mind share; Yahoo Photos is driving real (unique) traffic. An all new Yahoo Photos is being released in March. It combines many of the most-loved features of Flickr (like tagging and sets) with some entirely new stuff that is pretty compelling. Exclusive screen shots of the new service are below. Yahoo Photos will be entirely free, and will allow uploading and archiving of an unlimited number of original high resolution pictures. Revenue will be generated from advertising on the site, along with premium printing and other services (books, calendars, prints, etc.). Like Flickr , Yahoo will also be allowing users to pick up prints at their local Target store. Yahoo Photos will integrate popular Flickr features, like tagging and sets, as well as popular printing options mentioned above. The screen shots below show some of these features. They are also doing new stuff. They have two types of “sets”, or albums. The standard sets work very much like Flickr. But “Smart albums” allow dynamic creation of albums based on rules (ratings, tags, date, etc.), and also allow inclusion of photos from friends. With smart albums, users can create albums like “highly rated” or “new” that will always be created on the fly. The all photos view is much better than Flickr. Many more photos can be viewed at once, and an Ajax interface allows for mass dragging and dropping into a tray at the top of the screen for inclusion in albums, sharing (via email and instant messaging), etc. They have not integrated RSS feeds for photos and albums yet, but this is coming. The Yahoo photos team includes Darryl Eaton, Will Aldrich, and Scott Schiller, who were all here at Demo this week. Screen shots:",Yahoo-Photos; Yahoo,2006-02-08 00:00:00
,Get Concert Info + Music At Podbop,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/16/814/,"Podbop launched today, and for music lovers it may be the most interesting mashup we’ve seen yet. They’ve combined concert events from eventful and mashed the data up with band sites that include downloadable music. The result? search for any city in the U.S. (hopefully this will soon expand to become a worldwide service) and get results (including RSS for future events) that include all upcoming live music and links to download music supplied by the band. If the band has no music available, Podbop will show a blogdigger search for that artist along with the eventful data. Here’s the best part. Subscribe to any search (Los Angeles, CA, for example), and the MP3 files are included as enclosures in the RSS feed. The service is new and data is limited. But look for this to be a cult favorite. And if they release an API, look to see Podbop’s data mashed up with other services, too. In the meantime, I’ve subscribed to the San Francisco feed .",,2006-02-16 00:00:00
,Mabber Mobile Instant Messaging,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/23/mabber-mobile-instant-messaging/,"Mix open instant messaging protocol Jabber with mobile phones and you get Mabber , a new product from a team based in Cologne, Germany. The team at Mabber were early adopters of the Jabber protocol and with the lower mobile data charges in their home country decided to develop an application that would allow mobile users to communicate with each other using the protocol, thus save on SMS costs. Mabber is a product of New Media Management, a German company that runs some of the countries largest web properties such as neu.de and pkw.de , Mabber have put together a very experienced and solid team that totals six people, starting with Nico Lumma who runs the team and directs the business (he is also a very popular blogger in Germany). Other members of the team include Florian Holzhauer (who is a member of the Jabber foundation), Stefan Strigler , Jens Ohlig , Oliver Lauer and Christian Horchert. Mabber primarily uses the Jabber protocol but they also have support for the other networks such as MSN, Yahoo!, AIM – this is so that you don’t need to lose contacts or functionality with your existing IM provider in switching to mabber. Mabber supports all these protocols in-line, meaning that once you have the account setup you see your contacts on that network along with your other contacts from other networks and the primary mabber network. There are two parts to the mabber application. The first is the web application which can be accessed from any browser. As with Meebo, these guys have spent a lot of time on refining the user experience. The first thing I noticed was that the chat windows did not have any re-draw effects and seemed to work seamlessly – no weird delays with the client polling the server, just instant reactions. Second what I noticed is all the rich features. They have extended through all the popular features of desktop IM clients such as chat history (which can be fully searched later), grouping (and group chat), and context menu’s to bring up the options. The web interface on it’s own will give Meebo a run for it’s money, but the magic with Mabber is on mobile devices. To install the mobile application you go to the site and enter your mobile number, you in return receive an sms with a download link, you follow that, it installs, executes, you enter your username and password and you are online. From that point you are able to access all your IM contacts and communicate with them using a standard mobile keypad. This will save people a lot on SMS costs (which are just blatant robbery in most countries at the moment) and allow people to communicate more effectively. I know that this is not the first mobile IM app, but the combination of this team, the protocol they have chosen, their simple application and both mobile and browser based interfaces means that Mabber stand a strong chance of success. I have been using Mabber for almost a day now and I am currently evaluating if this is my Meebo replacement. Nico has been talking about a few features they have due during the course of this week including tabbed chatting windows, content delivery to mobile devices and other improvements. These guys are releasing very frequently and their private beta has been going well to date. They intend on going out strong in the German market and I am sure they will do well in other markets especially if ordinary consumers find the service as easy to install and use as I did. Use Mabber Now: Mabber have been kind enough to give away 50 beta invitations for Techcrunch readers. If you would like to check out a really cool IM app that works on mobile devices then send through an email to info@mabber.com with the subject line of ‘TECHCRUNCH!!!!!’ and you will be sent an invitation in return.",,2006-02-23 00:00:00
,Google Pages Released,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/22/google-pages-released/,"Although there has been no official announcement yet Google have released the long awaited and long-rumored Google Pages (which has nothing to do with cloning Larry Page). Pages allows users to create a webpage using an AJAX interface that removes a lot of the ‘pain’ associated with creating pages with HTML and other desktop design applications. If you have some time on your hands and would like to try this out, then head over to http://pages.google.com to signup. If you have an existing Google account (they snuck that on us, didn’t they) then getting a pages account is very simple. Once you are in the application you are presented with a WYSIWYG interface displaying your page and some editing controls. The interface in terms of what they have done with client-side Javascript is impressive, and what Google has done in terms of putting up simple pages is cool but overall it is an underwhelming gimmick that may have some potential if they focus. Google Pages allows you to upload files, create many pages that you can link up, and select from a smorgasbord of templates. The website which you can then push out to publish can then be found at username.googlepages.com. I went through and created my own page which can be found at http://cubrilovic.googlepages.com . The retro look demonstrates the problem with giving your content creators too much control and not wrapping them up more tightly into a nice template. The way it usually works with real website design is that the design wraps the content creator up completely simply so they don’t mess things up – only because we aren’t all creative types. Google Pages does let you upload any file though, and gives you 100MB of space, which some may find more useful for sharing files or distributing SNL video’s. For instance, this is not going to be a threat to the younger crowd who are all creating pages on MySpace , nor to the audience of millions of bloggers who already have their online presence, nor to the players in the CMS space who offer a whole lot more in functionality and power. I am not sure who this is targeted at as the small business owners and non technical folk sure aren’t looking at Google for a website solution and considering there is no domain mapping at the moment being a business and handing out a googlepages.com domain is just, well, embarrassing . I don’t think we will see a huge swell in the number of serious websites hosted on pages, but this may be a step towards a CMS suite for small businesses that would include some form of super-blogger, along with free domain registration or some of the other features that Office Live will be offering. I just can’t help thinking that this product feels unfocused and underdeveloped – especially coming from a company such as Google. Update : A few minutes after I posted this Google took the site down. I hope I didn’t lose all my work.",,2006-02-22 00:00:00
,Blogbeat Rocking The Blog Stat Beats!,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/21/blogbeat-rocking-the-blog-stat-beats/,"Google recently indicated that they are taking blogs and measuring blog statistics very seriously with their acquisition of Measure Map . Measure Map had not yet made it into the hands of most bloggers and had been in a private beta at the time of acquisition. A new blog analytics tool that is similar in functionality to Measure Map is BlogBeat . The different with BlogBeat is that it is available to everyone now. A few days ago I installed BlogBeat on my own blog – the installation procedure involved copying a snippet of HTML into the footer template of my WordPress install (it will work with any blogging application where you can edit and access the template). The process of signing up and installing took no longer than a minute, and I was able to instantly see who was accessing my site along with all the other statistics the service provides. BlogBeat will read information about your blog, as well as derive post statistics, from the RSS feed URL that you need to specify. The front page of BlogBeat displays to the user an overview of their traffic stats and highlites trends. You will need to have the code running for a few days to get meaningful data from this front page – for example the monthly summary does not mean much unless you have been running the package for a month (perhaps something that should be hidden until then). The interface to BlogBeat is very simple and clean, not as attractive as the interface for MeasureMap but at the same time very practical. BlogBeat being blog-specific can tell you statistics such as which posts are the most popular, which categories are popular and also tracks comments to tell you which posts are most commented and what the most recent comments are. With post statistics it also displays trends, though with most statistic packages shows you that the fastest growing posts or pages are the most recent (since they didn’t exist yesterday the ‘growth’ is always 600%+) – something else that should be accounted for if the intention is to make clear older posts that may have become popular again for whatever reason (something that is common on my own blog). Further there are areas that describe where your visitors are coming in from, how they have found your blog or a specific post and what keywords have been used to find your site via search engines. The last section describes which outbound links are the most popular and from which points users are leaving your page. One simple feature that BlogBeat doesn’t show me that others do is what browsers my visitors are using, though this isn’t the most useful stat it is good to know. I am sure that we will see this feature shortly. They are also working hard on FeedBurner integration (its there already, see my update at the end of this post) and have cool features like being able to subscribe to your stats (BlogBeat will also have an API). I found overall that BlogBeat is a much better way of tracking my sites visitors (though I am not surprisingly a stats-obsessed blogger, I know a lot who are) over Google Analytics (overkill). The concerns I have with the javascript include method of tracking stats is that first it can slow down page loading if the tracking app is experiencing heavy load (something that visitors to blogs which are being tracked by Measure Map have probably experiences) and second that using Javascript may not be a true representation of all visitors since some browsers wont execute it and others may not be able to (the developers still need to make sure the tracking code works on all browsers such as Safari etc.) . The alternative is to use a statistics package that can access server logs directly, but with that you sacrifice ease of installation and not all bloggers have such access to their servers. BlogBeat is free for the first 30 days and thereafter it is $6 per month (limit to 500,000 page views per month, not sure what happens if you exceed). They currently have around 400 users and the performance is good, only time will tell if that will hold up. It is good to see more competition in this space and some good offerings. I will stick with BlogBeat for now and decide before the trial expires if I am getting $6 a month worth of value out of it. Update : John from BlogBeat emailed me to say that they do have demographic and browser stats (I just didn’t see it because it was at the bottom), and Feedburner integration is there now. This is a great solution already with a lot more to come",,2006-02-21 00:00:00

They have earmarked a further $2 billion for future acquisitions. Ross also said that he wouldn’t be surprised if “Fox acquired at least five of the companies in the room” soon. Dan Farber, who was first to write about this , confirmed with Ross that it is not MySpace competitor Tagged.

,Super-Stealth Ether To Launch Tonight,https://techcrunch.com/2006/03/01/super-stealth-ether-to-launch-tonight/,"Tonight at midnight the doors open (to beta testers) at Ether , the new super-stealth startup that is wholly-owned by the pay-per-call folks at Ingenio . The concept of Ether is straightforward, but it has a massive back end infrastructure (thankfully Ingenio already had it built). They call it an “ebay for services”, allowing people to charge for advice over the phone (and by email – more on that below). Service providers set up an account by providing some personal information and a phone number that they would like to be called at. Any service that can be provided over the phone is a perfect match for Ether. “Sellers” set their price, from free to anything (on a per minute or per hour basis). They can tell Ether the hours they are willing to take calls. Every seller is issued a toll free phone number (with a dedicated extension), which forwards to their phone. Buyers can search through providers, see prices, feedback, etc. Once they agree to terms, they can place the call. Sellers only get calls once a Buyer has paid the fee and agreed to the terms. Ether takes a flat 15% of fees for its trouble. They cover long distance charges and credit card processing fees out of this 15%. And the fun doesn’t stop there. Sellers can also sell any type of digital content through Ether as well. The buyer is able to access the content only after paying the agreed upon fee. This content can be emailed out to people, or accessed via a link/badge that can be placed on a website. The combination of phone advice, plus the ability to charge for digital content, opens up all kinds of possibilities. At first glance, I saw this as a kind of Web 2.0 elance …but after testing out the service its clear that it goes way beyond what previous services in this space did. Ether brings people together directly via calls or email, and sets up a great billing mechanism in between the parties. I expect Ether to ramp quickly towards success, and it will be extremely hard for competitors to enter the space given the capital intensive infrastructure needed to do something like this. See Robert Scoble on Ether as well, who met with the team last week and asks “Anyone have any ideas of how they’d use Ether?”",Ingenio; Ether,2006-03-01 00:00:00
,"Lunch In Israel: Six Startups, A Vc And A Blogger",https://techcrunch.com/2006/03/01/lunch-in-israel-six-startups-and-a-vc/,"Last Sunday I attended an ad hoc tech lunch in Tel Aviv, Israel to meet six great web 2.0 startups there. Attending were founders from I4giveu, Maxthon, Raw Sugar, Spotback, Triplay and Yedda. Daniel Cohen from Gemini Israel Funds , Ouriel Ohayon ( TechCrunch France author) and other tech enthusiasts were there as well. We had a great meal and a great discussion. My pictures from the event are up on flickr here . The six startups that were represented include: Founder Alon Carmel is a gifted designer and developer and is getting ready to launch his stealth project I4giveu. Very few details on the service were revealed, but as always I love the email collecting landing page with promises of amazement in a very short time. Sign up here . One thing Alon did say was this: “Each user will earn his reputation from angel to devil according to his post ranked by other community users.” Sounds like fun! Netanel Jacobsson represented Maxthon Browser , the controversial but popular IE based browser that has surpassed 50 million downloads. Ouriel Ohayon writes about Maxthon here . The executive team of Raw Sugar is based in Silicon Valley, the development effort is led by Frank Smadja out of Haifa, Israel. I’ve written about Raw Sugar on TechCrunch previously , and they are moving toward launch of a new feature which will automatically import tag and category information from blogs to create a single browsable and searchable directory. Great stuff. Spotback founders Micha Kaufman and Amit Kaufman gave me an early look at credential-protected Spotback, which is going to be a winner . Look for a full profile soon, but Spotback is a personalized news and rating/sharing site that has very strong features and will give front runners like Newsvine a real run for their money. Design and functionality is top notch. Sign up for the beta here . I would not be surprised if Spotback received joint Israel-US VC funding in the very near future. Yaron Orenstein spoke to me briefly about Triplay, a very young company that is looking to create a cross-platform mul­ti­me­dia platform (computer-mobile-television). There are very few details on the site, but Triplay looks interesting. “Think People NOT technology…TriPlay’s Super Messaging service will enable people to easily communicate all types of media and content across their PC, TV, and Mobile devices.” Look for a full review on MobileCrunch soon. I’ve been talking to Yaniv Golan and Avichay Nissenbaum, the founders of Yedda, since last December. See my teaser post on them from January. Yedda should be taking the wrapper off their service within the next few weeks, and I’ll be dong a full profile. All of these entrepreneurs are humble and flat out brilliant.

,New Feedburner Stats And Features,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/28/new-feedburner-stats-and-features/,"Feedburner CEO Dick Costolo emailed Richard MacManus and me on Monday to give us a preview of what he calls “broad enhancement to our stats” that are being released later this morning. I’ve had a chance to review the new functionality (screen shot below) and I agree that these changes are both needed and useful. The key change is to give users more information on what items in feeds are actually getting “viewed” and clicked on. Until now bloggers could not get this information – analytics services  like MeasureMap and BlogBeat give us good insight into what’s being done on the actual site, but unless a click through to the site occurs from a feed, there was little or no information on what was actually being read off site. FeedBurner’s new stats go a long way toward mitigating this problem. They are also showing what they call “uncommon” sources which allow bloggers to see where their feeds are being read and re-used beyond the standard RSS readers like Rojo and Bloglines, and new tools for podcasters to track downloads. Dick summarized all of the new features in his email: This comes on the heals of FeedBurner’s 2 year birthday and announced funding from Union Square Ventures earlier this month. The company has raised a total of $10 million to date.",FeedBurner,2006-02-28 00:00:00
,Maxthon: The Browser That Rocks,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/28/maxthon-the-browser-that-rocks/,"Maxthon is in my view the best alternative to Internet Explorer.

Founded by the very young and brilliant Jeff Chen in 2003 in China (under MyIE name), Maxthon became very quickly popular in Asia (awarded last year in Red Herring Asia ) and all over the world. The big difference with other browsers is that Maxthon is based on IE code which makes the software very familiar from the beginning but with a few twists. Unlike IE, it is very fast, safe and very stable and brings a unique browsing experience as it enables you to customize nearly any part of the software. Like Firefox,  Maxthon brings tab browsing, embedded RSS and podcast reader (a very cool one ), search bar… but without necessity to add any extension. The key strength of Maxthon is that it enables you to customize totally your browsing experience with extreme simplicity. A few examples: URL shortcuts. Instead of typing a URL or clicking a bookmark (ok it takes less than 2 sec but still) you can set up a URL alias (“2” for instance) and type directly in the URL bar which will lead you to the URL of your choice (eg: your flickr page). You can change easily skins, a wide choice is offered. Mouse gesture is also great just like super drag and drop features to save an image or initiate a search on a given word within web page. There are too many features to cover them all here. I believe you should play with it first (tip: use your right click nearly anywhere). All those I know who tried it loved it. It sounds maybe too much like FireFox in some way but again it is not. To better understand the pros of Maxthon read this article from Internet Week . We could get exclusive intial screenshots and news on next 2.0 version to come up soon. I believe Maxthon will become even better. They are building right now a better interface with greater possibilities of customization, data sharing, multi window browsing, cool blogging features and many other things kept secret for now. Great quality leads to great popularity and Maxthon just passed 50 million downloads (announced on their blog but also on Daily OM ) Beyond a good product and critical size,  Maxthon has great assets for success: first a great team including Netanel Jacobsson as SVP Bus. Development (ex AOL/ICQ guy). Second, strong shareholders including Morten Lund (a Skype early stage investor) and WI Harper . Maxthon is not yet very popular in the US, but i bet it’ll change soon. Now let’s see if this post can generate a debate just as hot as the one from the original post in TechCrunch France :)",,2006-02-28 00:00:00
,Killer New Live.Com Service: Street-Side,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/28/killer-new-livecom-service-street-side/,"Microsoft’s Live.com is launching a preview version of a new service called Street-Side today (link will be live around 12 PST today). Street-Side will augment the Live Local service and give street level views of the entire city. Searches can be made by address or business name, and you can “drive” around the city using the arrow keys. See the screen shot below for a visual. See Robert Scoble’s Channel 9 Video for his interview with the team. The service will initially target San Francisco and Seattle only due to the massive number of images needed to support make it work (rumors are 10 million + images per city). The Live.com team sent out an email to journalists that includes the following information: Live.com continues to crush competiting ajax homepage competitors (see link for Alexa chart).

See my previous  posts on Expo for additional information and screen shots. Expo is centered on the idea that people will trust others within a group, and so is allowing classifieds networks within groups.

Participants can create profiles, upload photos, add members as friends, chat, etc. The search functionality is great – type in just about any physical attribute, from bust size to eye color, and get your model match. They offer a seven day free trial for people interested in trying out the service. Solomodels is all business though. The site warns: So don’t even think about it.

,Exclusive Look At Google Payments,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/27/exclusive-look-at-google-payments/,"Google announced last week on their blog that they will begin to facilitate payments on Google Base in the near future. The blog post from Google pointed out that Google are already accepting payments on their video service as well as when users purchase software such as Google Earth and that this will be extended further in the near future. The latest updates to Google Base , which we have been able to take a good look at, is to compete directly with eBay by not only allowing sellers to post items to base, but also by facilitating the transaction through Google Payments (see this blog post on purchasing via Base from the Google Base team). To see some items on Google Base that are accepting payments via Google go to base.google.com and search for either ‘ xyzzy ‘ for a list of items with payments enabled, or ‘ magic unicorn beanie ‘ for a particular item. The first thing you see is that a price has been set and you can see that the payment method that is accepted is ‘payment through google’. While ordinary users now won’t get an option to purchase these items, we managed to get some screenshots of how the process will look and work. The next set of screens show the items that had a big ‘buy’ button on them so that the user can purchase them: The payments site currently redirects to your Google account details but upon public launch, and available on very few select accounts at the moment, the user will have the option to specify or update their credit card details as well as their delivery address details. This means that as a user of Google Payments you won’t need to re-enter this information when making a purchase on Base, or any of the other services from Google that will be taking advantage of the new system. In addition on your account page you will see a history of items that you have purchased and you will be able to check the delivery status of items being delivered, as well as information about the seller of items you have purchased. Our understanding is that Google is currently testing this service further internally and are in talks to potential sellers on using Google Base and their new payment system to sell items. From the users point of view, it makes purchasing items on any Google property extremely simple. The checkout process is extremely quick and much faster than Paypal’s (page loading times are Google fast) – it also has a much nicer interface making it easier for a user to navigate their way through a checkout and purchase. Overall with Google Base and payments the experience for a user is much nicer than what it is on eBay, a very nice interface and many search features while maintaining the very minimal yet functional interface as expected from Google. I can see that they will be able to maintain this nice interface even as the inventory of items for sale gets much much bigger – their choice of using tags for items as opposed to categories makes it much easier to find items and to fine-tune search results. What Google does lack at the moment, and something they are working on, is a reputation system so that you can authenticate who the seller is and how trustworthy they are. Building a good reputation system is a very big problem, one that eBay has yet to completely solve so it will be interesting to see what Google will do about this. I don’t know if launching without a reputation system is a good idea, their short-term solution may be to restrict sellers using their payment system to more trusted sources. What we are seeing here from Google is a direct shot at eBay’s market, as well as other services such as Craigslist – though they have some way to get there. The new payments system means we should see many more services and offerings from Google in the future that cost money, it has made Google Base a lot more interesting and also started up a much needed additional source of revenue.",Google,2006-02-27 00:00:00
,Edgeio Launches,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/27/edgeio-launches/,"After much anticipation and a period of being available to a private audience the team at Edgeio took the covers off of their creation tonight and launched to the general public. Edgeio takes listings (classifieds) from RSS-enabled sources and organizes them in a central location for users to be able to browse and search. The Edgeio ethos is that content belongs on the edges, and that is where the name originates from (Edge input/output). Content on the edges means the content on the millions of blogs and other sites out there which Edgeio does a good job of aggregating and organizing. From a seller’s perspective, to post an item you write about it on your blog and tag it ‘listing’ (along with any other keywords which are suitable to categorize the item for sale). Edgeio taps into the blog cloud via weblogs.com and other ping services (as well as its own ping server which is at http://www.edgeio.com/RPC2 ) to find new posts that have been tagged for listing. Once it finds your post, which usually happens very quickly, it will send a trackback to your post to make you aware that Edgeio has found it. Once you have posted, the first time you post an item you will need to go to Edgeio to claim your blog (a process that works similar to Technorati’s) from which point you can add additional metadata to your listing within Edgeio. The additional data you enter includes things like additional tags to categorize the item, your geographic location (which again you only enter once and is used when you search for items to buy as well) and the price of the item. It only takes moments from the time you post your listing to the time that it appears in Edgeio and is available for buyers to find. From a buyers perspective, you can go to Edgeio and then find items that are for sale a number of ways. The first and most obvious way is to enter terms into the search box. This will display results which are item summaries sorted in chronological order. The other way to find items is by browsing through the tag clusters that are located on the front page and working your way down to items that interest you. The last way in which you can find items is interesting, as Edgeio has lists of most popular items, the latest items and the most active weblogs posting items. The popular items list and the latest items list have feeds available for users to subscribe to or use in other applications. One cool thing you notice is the geography slider widget that is persistently in the sidebar while you are looking through items. If you are looking at search results and would like to filter them down to just the state you are in, or the zip code you are in, then you just slide the slider. I have been told that this slider will be even more fine-grained in the near future by giving ‘slide points’ which are certain distance radiuses around the current points (eg. Within 10 miles of your current post code). The way the slider works and refreshes the results or the page automatically has been very well implemented and makes a lot of sense. The interface has been very well done, it is clean and easy to understand (I tested this by handing over the URL to a non-tech user and they were able to find listings the may be interested in). Throughout the search results, listings from blogs that have been claimed gain precedence over unclaimed listings. In the future sellers will have the ability to highlight their listing for a small fee. Reputation is currently handled via third party sites, the seller has an option to associate their listing with their Flickr, eBay or LinkedIn account so that their credibility can be traced back. It appears at the moment that a lot of the transactions on Edgeio will be face-to-face transactions, where verifying credibility is different as opposed to when you are sending payment to somebody you don’t know in a foreign country or another state. The whole point of Edgeio is to connect the buyer and seller through its platform that aggregates listings, so there are no payment options at the moment nor can you see any account history from buyers or sellers on what they have purchased or sold before. It is currently being left up to the buyer and seller to close the transaction. Edgeio also offers a lot of social controls as a means to keep the listing relevant and current. Users are able to mark a listing as being ‘bad’ by telling Edgeio that the item is spam, that it is no longer current, that is hasn’t been categorized correctly or that the publishers information is not accurate. These forms of social controls and filtering work well on sites such as Craigslist and their effect on Edgeio and how well they work to prevent spam will only be known over time. On important aspect to Edgeio is the availability of feeds for every part of the system. With standard RSS feeds ( Dave Winer is an advisor to the company) developers of other applications or webmasters are able to include items for sale on Edgio into their own sites or applications, or take the listings further in some form of a mashup (I am guessing we will see the first mashups – potentially with Google Maps, shortly). I like the idea of being able to subscribe to a feed that will display new items that may not be available now but I wish to purchase – so I will see them as soon as they are posted. I subscribe to the theory that the publishing and control of content belongs to the user and that we are heading in that direction. There are a few reasons for this, the first and most important is that the user owns his or her data, even if it is something as simple as a classified listing, so the user should be able to have effective control over the environment where this data is contained. With centralized services such as eBay and Craigslist the buyer and seller are left to the mercy of the platform provider. Blogging has enabled users to create content and publish it on the web easily, so using that platform for listings is only one of a number of potential services that can be built on top of what we have today. The short-term barriers I foresee are the size of this market today and how effective Edgeio will be in promoting itself as the standard place for listings. In terms of scalability, only a much larger inventory will be able to test the theory of having tags and tag clusters as a directory as opposed to a rigid directory structure (which is very hard to maintain and expand). Edgeio is putting categorization and the categories themselves into the hands of users with self-monitoring in place that will attempt to assure that things don’t get out of hand. While having 1,300 or so listings at the time of launch is a good start, the size of the market and the number of listings on blogs will not compare to eBay or Craigslist any time soon (though Edgeio can also use other directories as sources as well, making it a classifieds meta-site). In the long-term there is a fantastic opportunity, especially since publishing to the web on your own terms is something that is becoming more and more available to ordinary web users (and with services such as MySpace and MSN spaces the number of users is getting really big). Edgeio is a very open platform, they want others to build applications and use the listing content in other sites and applications. I am sure that regardless of the success of Edgeio that its more traditional competition has had to think about their own policies with providing feeds and other openness measures and I hope that the launch of Edgeio may spur change with other platforms. Edgeio was founded by Keith Teare (easyNet and Realnames) and Micheal Arrington (Techcrunch) along with the founding technical team consisting of Matt Kaufman (There and Realnames) and Vidar Hokstad (Yahoo! Europe). Edgeio have raised $1.5M in angel capital from a large list of investors with names such as Louis Monier, Frank Caufield, Auren Hoffman, the RSS Investors Fund, Jeff Clavier , Ron Conway and Michael Tanne. Edgeio will need to overcome those barriers, as well as have more and more sellers adopt the model that they are pushing (ie. The ‘listing’ tag). They are going the right way about it, with a very nice interface and some very cool features, along with the will to make this happen and the right people to see it through. The launch is also being reported by Om Malik amonst others . Disclaimer: Mike Arrington, a founder of Edgeio is also the Founder of this blog.

,Tangler Untangling Communication On The Web,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/21/tangler-untangling-communication-on-the-web/,"Over the weekend I spoke to Martin Wells, the founder and CEO of a startup from Sydney, Australia called Tangler . I had a look at the application they have been developing for the last 18 months now which is an instant messaging and communication app that is based around a concept they call ‘instant grouping’. Instant grouping means that any number of people can take part in conversations around topics of interest they find on the web or in other applications. The application allows users to subscribe to a group – which can then be linked to any number of blogs, websites, music files (in iTunes or other apps), a point on a map or anything else. The conversations are persistent so you don’t need to be there when other people are and the desktop application will notify you when something new happens in a group. This alleviates the problem some have seen at the moment with instant messaging applications tied to blogs by making each group an actual destination where users can make comments and have conversations. Tangler does a good job of uniting people around a common interest and letting them take part in conversations. This is where instant messaging has been heading for a while now, but Tangler looks to have gotten it right. The guys have been spending some time in the valley recently while they prepare the company and the product for a public launch. Tangler has been privately funded to date but Martin has indicated they have investment interest from the USA at the moment which they are considering. Tangler are planning to open up the private beta in 2 months – in the interim you can register your interest in their product on their website. I am eagerly awaiting the launch since I have seen many attempts at trying to make communication around a topic or website on the web easier and it seems that these guys are approaching it the right way and doing it well.",Tangler,2006-02-21 00:00:00
,Flyspy Brings The New Web To Airline Ticketing,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/20/flyspy-brings-the-new-web-to-airline-ticketing/,"At the Mashup Camp pre-conference dinner tonight there were a number of demos, all of which were interesting. A non-public service that stood out was flyspy , a search engine for airline tickets that will change the way we all travel. Purchasing flights purely based on price has been around for a while, but the consumer has never had the power to quickly and at a glance evaluate the cheapest days to fly nor the cheapest destinations to fly to. Flyspy reverse engineers some of the mystique associated with the airline industry and makes it extremely transparent. Tonight I got a look at the service, and while it is still in it’s early stages it is very cool. The way it works is that I give it a departure city and a destination city and optionally a departure date and length of stay. The search result, which returns very quickly, will present me with a graph of flight prices over the next 30 days so that I can quickly look at which days are the cheapest to fly. To book a flight I just click on the point in the graph. Simple. If I am trying to decide which destination is cheaper, I can overlay another airport on the graph and then compare the results. In the screenshot you can see that it has plotted the prices for arriving in both San Francisco and San Jose. The end result is that in very little time I can find the best day to fly out, the best price and also the best destination. Flyspy has all the right elements – a good idea, a simple user interface and an immediate value proposition for the user. Even better, it takes an industry that is stuck in the old times and shakes it up (I was going to say blown to bits ). Flyspy was founded by Robert Metcalf (no not that one ) who has been working on the problem for 2 years after experiencing frustrations with the airline booking system (someone pissed off the wrong programmer). Even though he had no previous experience in the industry Robert was obviously very knowledgeable on how it all worked and how to build a business from what he has built so far. Flyspy will have an API that will allow other developers to tap into its technology and to integrate it with other services. Robert is expecting to move out to the valley sometime soon and has been self-funded to date (though he is in the process of seeking investment). Overall a very cool service that epitomizes what the new web is about. Flyspy should go public in a few months – you will hear more about it here and probably feel the distruption.",,2006-02-20 00:00:00
,Foldera: Never Organize Your Inbox Again,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/20/foldera-never-organize-your-inbox-again/,"Huntington Beach, California based Foldera ‘s goal is to organize all of the chaos surrounding work based documents (email, calendar, office documents, instant messaging, etc). It is a very big idea. The company is in private beta right now, with a full launch on the way. Foldera’s approach to productivity is in direct conflict with the way we use applications like Outlook today (just think about how much time we all spend organizing our inbox, filing emails, etc.). Foldera has a better approach (one that seems rather obvious now that I’ve seen it) and they have a chance to seriously disrupt upcoming product launches like Office Live from Microsoft. Most of us are used to working with email folders today, where an email message can simply be pulled into a folder for easier discovery later. The idea around Foldera starts there. They’ve created an Ajax rich web application that includes email, calendaring, instant messaging, document storage and versioning, tasks and other features into a single web application. Everything is folder-centric: Richard Lusk, Foldera’s CEO, met with me late last year to show me an early demo of the product. The idea is that you create a folder around any new project. Share that folder with others or keep it private. Documents can be uploaded to the service and associated with a folder. Emails started from within the folder are automatically associated with the project. Same with Calendar entries. Foldera also includes an instant messaging application (it works with MSN Messenger, Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), iChat, and Yahoo Messenger). The notion of taking emails, IM transcripts, office documents, calendar items and more and automatically organizing each document into shared or private folders is a big deal. Having one place to see every related document will save time. And as deadlines approach, users can simply focus on the project folder and ignore distracting emails and IMs that deal with other projects. Pricing has not yet been disclosed, but there will be a generous free option. Foldera has raised $13 million since its launch. Last week it completed a reverse merger into an existing (shell) public company, raising an additional $8.5 million. It is now a publicly traded (OTC) company with a market capitalization of $70 million. Yeah, its crazy – they haven’t even launched yet.",,2006-02-20 00:00:00
,"Meebo: More Features, Continued Growth",https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/19/meebo-more-features-continued-growth/,"Since launching last year, Meebo the web-based instant messaging application has had phenomenal growth and great user adoption. This week they have announced a new set of features and upgrades to their application, the first since they announced their funding from Sequoia capital . The best of the new features are that you can now create an account with Meebo and have access to all your instant messaging accounts with a single sign-on. The problem I have had to date with Meebo is that I do have a number of different accounts on different networks but the single sign-on and having a Meebo account solves that. They have added some cool features to it such as being able to sign in with a default status of invisible, see all your contacts across all networks in a single list, and having as many accounts as you wish. Single sign-off is coming shortly I am told. I was at a dinner with Meebo co-founder Seth Sternberg during the week and he talked about these new features, the continuing growth as well as Meebo’s plans for the future. These guys are working on some exciting things and are now handling their large load of users well with more servers. Their growth is still extremely strong: they hit a new record of 396,000 connections in a day last week. I am using Meebo as my full-time instant messaging client from today – and it is working well so far. Many of the incremental improvements have made the experience enjoyable for the user. It will be interesting to see how the competition responds to what Meebo are doing and if they will be able to sustain this growth over the next few months and beyond.",Meebo,2006-02-19 00:00:00

,Allpeers Is Coming; Exclusive Screenshots,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/16/allpeers-is-coming-exclusive-screenshots/,"Prague based Allpeers cofounder Matthew Gertner came by my house today to install the product and let me try it out. Allpeers is a Firefox extension that creates a simple, persistent buddy list in the browser. Initially, interaction with those buddies will be limited to discovering and sharing files – If you choose to, you can share any file on your network with one or more of your friends. They will be able to see what files you choose to share (even getting an RSS feed of new files you include), and with a single click download it to their own hard drive. See my original post on Allpeers for more information. Matt took me through installation and setup of the product, and he shared a number of files with me. The interface for adding friends and sharing files is intuitive. Adding a file into Allpeers requires only dragging it from the hard drive into the browser, and sharing the file requires only a single click. The service is not yet freely available, and Matt says that 35,000 people have requested to be notified by email when the service goes live. As I wrote before, Allpeers is the “Killer App” for Firefox – Mozilla based Flock and Songbird should immediately be working to convert the basic Allpeers extension to work on their platforms as well.

,37 Signals Launches Campfire,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/16/37-signals-launches-campfire/,"Campfire , the new 37 Signals product, launched yesterday. It is a dead simple way to create a robust, permanent (with URL) group chat. Key features include embedded images, permanent URL for chat, no client to download (chat is in the web page), and easy file sharing. I’m basically thinking of it as a real time wiki or an easy to use IRC product with enhanced features. They claim it takes 10 seconds to create a new chat, and they are correct. It is dead simple to use and has an incredibly intuitive interface. It’s a great addition to the 37 Signals product suite. Pricing ranges from free to $50/month based on number of chat users and storage desired. To learn more about how Campfire works, take the tour .",37-Signals,2006-02-16 00:00:00
,Naked Conversations Techcrunch Party Tomorrow,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/16/naked-conversations-techcrunch-party-tomorrow/,"I’m pretty excited about the Naked Conversations TechCrunch Party tomorrow night starting at 7 pm. We’ve been working hard for weeks to get the event together and, thanks to our sponsors ,  this should be the best one so far. A huge tent is up in the back yard, food and drinks are on the way, and there will be plenty of people to help out with the event. Attendees have been limited due only to space restrictions in my house. The final list of attendees is here . If you are not on the list, don’t worry, we’ll be having TechCrunch 6 soon. Please note, and I apologize for this ,  RSVP’s will be checked at the door and if you are not on the list, you will not be able to get in. I want to take this opportunity once again to thank Robert Scoble and Shel Israel for having the party here, and to thank each of the sponsors of the event: If you are attending the party, please use the tag “TechCrunch5” on any publicly posted pictures. Thank you.",,2006-02-16 00:00:00
,Everyone Send Me $5,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/15/everyone-send-me-5/,"TextPayMe is coming out of beta on a SMS payment service (U.S. only) that allows anyone to send money to anyone else via cell phone. You simply sms the payment to another phone number. The service is currently free, and they are giving every new user $5 to sign up (this really reminds me of the early days with paypal, where they also gave $5 for every new signup and you could beam payments between Palm Pilots). Your TextPayMe account can be tied to your bank account for moving money into and out of the virtual account. You can also give TextPayMe your credit card for “overdraft” payments. It looks like they will eventually charge for transactions, but the service is free for now. Before everyone gets too excited about TextPayMe, note that PayPal is launching something similar , called “PayPal Mobile”. What would be ideal is if this was picked up by the cell phone service providers, and payments were simply credited or debited from your phone bill. I’d also like to see something like this partnered with BillMonk . To test the service, sign up for an account and sms $5 to my cell phone. :-)",,2006-02-15 00:00:00
,Microsoft Office Live Goes Into Beta,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/15/microsoft-office-live-goes-into-beta/,"Microsoft Office Live went into beta today . The service was first revealed at a Microsoft event last fall – you can see my post about it here . This is not an online version of Microsoft Office. It is a set of online tools for businesses to help them have a web and email presence at a very low cost (starting at free with ad support). The core tools are a free non-microsoft domain name, website and up to 50 email accounts with 2 GB of storage each. For a small company needing a informational website, it will be great. Given that the domain name, website building, hosting and email will all be free, this will be very attractive to a small business. For customers needing more, Microsoft will offer a suite of additional productivity applications – 22 in all were announced last fall. They will also support third party applications – ADP’s payroll software was shown integrated into Office Live. A set of APIs will be available for third parties to add their application functionality into Office Live. Among the additional applications is an office document collaboration tool. You can share an office document real time with others, allowing them to view and edit it. Impressive. Office Live should become a starting point for small businesses wanting a web presence and a general platform to run their business operations. If you are interested in participating in the beta, sign up at the main Office Live site . It is currently only open to U.S. businesses – the full service will launch later this year.",Live.com; Microsoft,2006-02-15 00:00:00
,Google Buys Measuremap,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/14/google-buys-measuremap/,"Google just announced that they have acquired Adaptive Path’s Measure Map (one of my most loved companies , more posts on them here ). No word on price…my wild ass speculation is $5 – $10m. Measure Map has not raised outside capital, and seems to be more of a drain on Adaptive Path resources at this point than an asset – the service has lagged very badly over the last few month, becoming unusable for larger blogs (although it has improved significantly recently). This will be a good addition to Google Analytics . Note that Jeffrey Veen of Adaptive Path wrote the post on Google’s blog. Jeffrey and other Measure Map employees will be moving over to Google along with the acquisition. Here’s what I love the most about this acquisition: Measure Map is still in private beta.",Measure-Map,2006-02-14 00:00:00
,Pimp Your Blog,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/14/pimp-my-blog/,"Stickam will launch tomorrow, February 15. The service allows users to easily create video and audio files, and additional tools to easily post these files to a website with a code snippet. The media files are played on the destination website in Flash. Bunchball has similar technology for integration of flash games into blogs and other websties. Stickam is free, has no bandwidth restrictions and up to 500 mb of storage. These are the kinds of tools that are already integrated quite nicely into sites like Tagworld. But if you are a more serious blogger and want to add just a bit of flair to your blog, Stickam may be for you.",Stickam,2006-02-14 00:00:00

Who will be the first to release an ajax interface for customizing blog templates? And speaking of Google rumors, exactly how long does it take to create an ajax calendar to integrate into Gmail?

,Technorati Now Has Authority,https://techcrunch.com/2006/02/13/technorati-now-has-authority/,"Assigning some sort of quality to real time search is necessary. Tracking incoming links to a particular post doesn’t work because, well, since this stuff is real time there is no time to track links. Memeorandum does track blog post links in near real time, but with a very small index of blogs. Tracking this across the entire blogosphere is much more difficult. Robert Scoble points out that Technorati has taken a shot at the problem, though. They’ve quietly released an “authority” slider to allow results to be filtered. See results anywhere from all blogs, to just blogs with hundreds of links. They assign authority to a post based on how many links a blog has. The image below shows the slider at the top and the text within the imagedescribes how it works. The slider is a bit buggy bu
